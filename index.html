  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <p>I am currently working at <a href="https://www.rollbar.com" target="_blank">Rollbar</a>
  as the Lead SDK Engineer. In the past few years I
  have worked at <a href="https://alan.eu" target="_blank">Alan</a>,
  <a href="https://www.flexport.com" target="_blank">Flexport</a>, and
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> doing software and data science
  related things.
  </p>

  <p>Before going to Facebook, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in Mathematical Finance at the
  <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">California Institute of Technology</a>; and before that I did my PhD at
  <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton University</a> focusing on applied
  probability and game theory.
  </p>

  <p>At the moment, most of this site is focused around my
  <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/">blog</a>, but things will be expanding <strike>quickly</strike> slowly.
