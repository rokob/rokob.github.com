  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <p>I am currently all things engineering at <a href="http://www.flexport.com" target="_blank">Flexport</a>. Prior to joining Flexport, I was a
  software engineer and data scientist at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.
 Before going to Facebook, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in Mathematical Finance at the
 <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">California Institute of Technology</a>; and before that I did my PhD at
<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton University</a>.
At the moment, most of this site is focused around my
<a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/">blog</a>, but things will be expanding <strike>quickly</strike> slowly.

<p><a class="btn primary large" href="{{ site.url }}/about/">More about me &raquo;</a></p>
