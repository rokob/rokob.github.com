  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>The standard biography page on most websites has come to be known as the
<em>About Me</em> page. I used to find the existence of such a page as a presumption
by the author that people cared about their life story. As such, About Me
pages seemed a little arrogant to me. However, I have come to think of
this page in different terms. The purpose of this page is for me to establish
my identity on the internet in my own words. Searching for someone on 
<a href="http://www.google.com/" title="Google">Google</a>
or looking at their <a href="http://www.facebook.com/aledvina" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/aledvina" title="Linkedin">Linkedin</a> profile 
tends to give a skewed
perspective. I want a place to tell my own story so that anyone who wants to
know where I am coming from can read this and hopefully get a clear picture.</p>
<p>I am going to jump around a lot in time so bear with me. I am at this instant
at <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/" title="Caltech">Caltech</a> doing a Postdoc in the Economics division. 
Prior to coming to Caltech, I was at <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/" title="Princeton">Princeton University</a> 
in the Operations Research &amp; Financial Engineering department. 
I obtained my PhD in June 2011. My thesis
research was on oligopoly games in continuous time. My research could be
classified as theoretical microeconomics, specically in the sub-fields of
game theory and industrial organization. Once I get my research page created
I will put a link to that here where you can find my thesis and research
papers.</p>
<p>To understand how I got to where I am it takes a long and circuitous
route that requires a jump back in time to grade school. I was exposed to
computers from a very early age with internet access as early as 1992. 
I was fascinated by everything technology related and spent a great deal of
my time learning how to get computers to do what I wanted, and of course 
playing video games. I built a FreeBSD box in my spare time which led
me naturally to learn Perl. I built and hosted my own personal website
out of my bedroom on my family's DSL connection. This required me to
learn Apache and how to run a nameserver. This all turned out to be
quite a good learning experience. At the time, I went by the handle
<em>BSD-Squrrel</em>, but I have since retired that.</p>
<p>At 14, I bid for and won the contract to design the website for my local
park district. I had taught myself HTML in grade school by making
sites on Angelfire and Geocities. I took a course in Junior High on web
design where I picked up Javascript. So, it seemed natural to me to sell
this knowledge as a service. I came in significantly under the other bids
because I did not really know the market rate at the time (1999), and further
they told me that my proposal looked much nicer than the rest of the
bids. I considered going after this as a full-time business but I found 
that dealing with the client after the initial build was extremely 
frustrating. Mainly because I knew what I was doing, but I was always treated
differently because I was less than half the age of everyone I had to deal
with.</p>
<p>Throughout high school, I continued to program in my spare time. I learned
C and a much different version of C++ than what we have now (i.e. no 
namespaces, STL, etc.). I did not develop that far because much of my time
was spent playing football and running track. During my junior year, I took
AP Computer Science which at the time was taught in C++. This was pretty
easy for me because I had already coded in the language.</p>
<p>I ended up going on to college at the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/" title="CU-Boulder">University of Colorado</a> in 
Boulder, CO. My original life plan from eigth grade up to my senior year of
high school was to be a computer programmer for a living. However, after
the tech bubble burst, the salaries became depressed and I decided to pursue
mathematics. However, near the end of my senior year of high school, due to
a variety of factors that influenced me, I decided to start college double
majoring in Chemistry and Economics. I had taken AP Chemistry and the 5 on
that exam put me into Organic Chemistry my freshman year. I am very happy
that I took that course because it taught me how much I did not like 
chemistry. Not that I do not enjoy the subject, but rather that I do not
have a passion for it that would make being an industrial chemist a viable
career option (as I was considering it to be at the time).
After you go through O-Chem though, there is not much left to
the chemistry major (if you are good at math) because the only hurdle left
is P-Chem. Economics, on the other hand, I did find decently interesting
but it was way too easy and slow for my tastes. Therefore, I switched into
applied math during my sophomore year while continuing to work towards the
chemistry major.</p>
<p>The applied math department at CU requires one to specialize in an area where
you apply your math. One of the tracks was quantitative finance. I decided
to go this route because it seemed the easiest way to make a lot of money
and still be able to work on hard things. This set me going on taking a lot
of finance and accounting courses which were even easier than the economics
courses. As it turned out much of the coursework overlapped with the
economics major because many of the courses were either cross-listed or
in the econ department. Therefore, I continued progress towards the major
in economics in the background. My career plans were "make a lot of money"
and "try not to be bored". I first thought of going into M&amp;A, but
as someone from a non-target school without many family friends in the
business, that was not going to happen. Besides, I thought, anyone can
take people out to dinner for a living, I am good at math and I like it,
why not find something where I can use that and still make lots of money.
This obviously means I decided to go into trading. I did not know what a sell
side trader was at that point or that that is what is meant when someone
says to go into S&amp;T.</p>
<p>I started to look into hedge funds, prop trading, and quantiative investing
methods in general. They seemed interesting, but I felt like there must be
some much more complicated things going on within such places that I just
did not understand. (Spoiler alert: it turns out the methods are not
fundamentally complicated, most of which require very little formal knowledge
to be able to comprehend). Therefore, I started to look for ways where I 
could learn this information. I thought one of the most obvious was was to
get some money and try to use math to invest it. This vague idea came out
of discussions with college friends who also had similar ideas. I started
investing a little on my own, and with no math whatsoever made quite a bit
on a handful of trades. The best trade having to do with the NYSE-ArcaEx
merger. This success led to some brainstorming and then eventual creation
of Copia Investments. Two friends and I raised a small amount of money
and created this investment vehicle. Our main strategy is commonly referred
to as merger <em>arbitrage</em> (also sometimes ridiculously <em>risk arbitrage</em>).
The term arbitrage is used so incorrectly in finance that such names do not
bother most people for some reason. There was a potential for a hedged
investment, but it was only profitable because of the risk involved (and
hence not an arbitrage). The basic story is Company A wants to buy Company B,
so A offers to trade each B share for one A share. B stock currently sells 
for less than A stock, say $10 less. The offer causes B stock to jump to 
something like $2 less. If it were riskfree then it would jump to exactly
the price of A stock, but there are many risk factors, so there is a 
discount. The quantitative aspect comes in determining the dollar value 
of the risk and assessing is $2 an over or under valuation of the given risk.
If you believe the risk of the deal happening is closer to zero (ignoring
carrying costs) then you can make a (statistcal) arbitrage by shorting A
stock in direct proportion to the B shares that you buy. For every one of
these trades you perform, you should take in $2 today, and if the deal goes
through, the shares will be equivalent and the two trades will offset each
other. So if you choose your deals right, assess the risks correctly, get in
early, and leverage the hell out of your trades, then this can be a very
profitable strategy. If you are an over-confident college kid who misjudges
a couple risks, then you have the potential to lose (or make) a lot of money
just by the luck of the draw. This is essentially what happened to us.
We made some and lost some because we did not appreciate the entire risk
profile of the deals that we got into. I still think the Texas State Police
were insider trading on one of the deals we got burned on, but that is a
story for another time. We eventually started to look into pair trading and
more automated trading strategies, but then internships and our futures
started to take a bigger priority.</p>
<p>I did not get the one internship that I wanted when I was a junior in
college. I was led to believe that being from a non-target school that I
would very little chance of landing the job I wanted. So, I figured, I could
go to graduate school at a target school and backdoor my way in. Therefore,
I made the decision to pursue a PhD because they are free if you go to a
decent place. I was legitmately interested in doing research and learning
all of the things about quantiative finance that I did not know, but my main
driver was the fact that I did not think I could get a top job out of CU.
Then, one day during the fall of my senior year, I got a call from Goldman,
Sachs. </p>
<p>To this day, I do not know the entire story behind how they got my resume,
or why they looked at it, but I have basically presumed that one of the
people in charge of the quantitative finance program at CU passed it along.
I never did apply and he (if he actually sent it) never told me he was
sending my info over. Therefore, when they called to ask if I had time for
a phone interview, I was a little taken back. I, of course, said sure. After
an hour or so on the phone a few days later, I had the feeling that I might
have a shot at a real interview. They called pretty quickly after that and
set me up with a flight to NY and a hotel. I went out there for a full day
of interviews within Global Alpha (their (now closed) internal hedge fund).
I talked to around 16 people that day. I really had no idea how it went,
because some went quite well, while others were basically staring contests
between myself and the interviewer. This was followed up by another
phone interview with 5 different people coming in and out of a conference
call (at 5:30am mountain time, by the way). I got a call a few days later
with an amazing job offer. I accepted their offer almost immediately because
I had not even planned on looking for jobs so theirs was my only offer. My
graduate school applications had yet to be mailed, so I decided to shrink
my application pool down to four schools: NYU, MIT, Princeton, and Harvard.
I was applying to Applied Mathematics departments. My thought process was
to take the job if I didn't get in anyway, and sort of hope I did not
get in any where so I would not have to deal with the other case. I was not
so lucky as I got in to half of the schools. Therefore, I had to decide
if I wanted to take a job making a (very) large amount of money for a 21
year old, or if I wanted to entire the poverty of graduate school. The
stipend and support at Princeton are some of the highest in all of academics,
so my ultimate choice of Princeton did not throw me into complete poverty.
Nonetheless, I did consider money when making the decision. I ultimately
came down to the realization that I wanted to get a PhD at some point, I felt
like I was missing a lot of knowledge, and an opportunity to get paid to
study at Princeton does not come up every day.</p>
<p>Part of my decision to go to Princeton was also based on the fact that I was
offered spot in the Operations Research &amp; Financial Engineering (ORFE)
department. This made sense based on my research statement and my intentions
going in. One of the things I was worried about in doing a PhD was that it
would not be applied enough. That is, I did applied math instead of pure
math because I like working in reality. One of my undergraduate advisors
gave me very good advice on this point: "doing a PhD can still be applied,
just at a higher level." I think she implicitly meant at a more abstract
level as well. This turned out to be very true. If you want your work to be
applied, it can be. If you want to just have some connection to reality,
you can have that too. I made it through the first year of courses and the
two 8 hour written qualifying exams at the end of the first summer. This
was more difficult than my undergraduate, but still not that difficult. It
took more consistent effort and focus that anything. I talked with one
professor about possibly doing research with him. He seemed to have some
problems that would interest me. But, when I started to talk to some older
students I was turned off to this professor. Also, I thought about my
interests and decided that I wanted to work in game theory. I knew there was
at least one professor that had some work in this area so I reached out to
him to see if he was interested. He said yes and that began my PhD research
relationship. The other professor (who shall remain nameless) acted quite
childish when I told him I had decided to work with someone else. He actually
sent me an email with a line to the effect "I see that the siren call of
finance has proven too alluring to you. Good luck with that. I have contacts
in the financial industry too." Within a few days, all of the grad students
in the department received through the department assistant forwarded
from this professor with a message about a job at some bank from one of his
former students. It turns out this guy has had issues with most of his
students and with many people who dropped him as an advisor or who also
considered him as I had. But, he has a lot of grant money and tenure so good
for him.</p>
<p>Anyways, my advisor and I went about working on a problem in differential
game theory related to oligopolistic markets. He had worked for a while with
some collegues on a model of Cournot (quantity setting) competition, and
the idea thrown my way was to consider something similar under Bertrand
(price setting) competition. It turns out these are similar in some ways,
and vastly different in many other ways. This started out as my research
project for my generals, but then blossomed into several related problems
that ended up taking up my entire thesis research. We worked on an additional
paper after I graduated, and are finishing up another related to one chapter
of my thesis this is yet to be published. All told, this will result in
four papers on oligopolistic competition. It was a pretty productive couple
of years. I initially thought, okay we will do this Bertrand paper and then
do something completely different but still in the field of games. We even
read a lot of literature that we never did anything with. However, it turns
out that there was (and still is) a lot of interesting problems that can be
studied in these oligopoly models. I will eventually (if it is not already
up yet) put all of these papers up on this site, including my thesis.</p>
<p>I went into grad school with the idea that if I did not like it, then I could
just leave with a free masters degree and go into finance. My intention
going into school was to go into industry, but I was advised by my
undergraduate professors not to say that in my personal statement. They said
that no department would accept me if I did not say I wanted to go into
academics. Moreover, they said to keep it to myself during my time there
because otherwise people would treat me differently. This is definitely true
in a pure math department, many applied math departments, economics
departments, and even in business school PhD programs. However, ORFE is
different. Less than half of the PhD students go to academics, either because
of desire to go to industry or lack of a decent academics job offer.
Therefore, it is ok in ORFE to say that you want to go to industry. However,
many advisors frown upon this and some will choose not to be your advisor.
They do this in subtle ways to not make this clear, but if they think you
are set on industry, then they will often try to put you onto someone else.
I went into school saying that I wanted to do academics and kept up that
story so that I would be treated well. Somewhere along the way, I started
to believe the story though. I started to look at academics as a possible
route that I might want to do. This is when the confusion began.</p>
<p>I am going to stop here for now because I do not have the time to finish
this mini-biography right now. I will finish this soon, but for now,
let us just say that I have decided to return to my roots.</p>
