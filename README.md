This is the source branch for my blog. This used to be deployed by Travis, but they shut down their
free tier so now it is run by Github Actions.

I used Jekyll for a long time and then moved to Gatsby to try it out and it has been not that bad. I
am considering moving to something simpler though because Gatsby is more than I need and it is
always terrifying to keep it up to date.
