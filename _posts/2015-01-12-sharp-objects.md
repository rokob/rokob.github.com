A couple years ago I picked up [*Gone Girl*][gone-amazon]
and was quite impressed. It was the kind of book that was
really hard to put down, and more than anything, the style
was incredibly relatable. Often I find it difficult to relate
to characters or themes because I find them to be fake or
outlandish, but for some reason *Gone Girl* made sense
to me. As an aside, I still haven't seen the movie but I
hear it is pretty good and I really want to see it, just
haven't gotten around to it yet. Long story short, I knew
that Gillian Flynn had other books, so threw one on my
reading list and it just happened to be [*Sharp Objects*][sharp-amazon].

This was a very good book. Not the kind of thing that will
be studied in literature courses in 100 years, but it
was my kind of story. It had my kind of characters. And it
was told in a way that I really enjoy. Maybe being from
the Midwest makes stories set in that region easier to
digest, I am not sure. I recommend this book to anyone,
although you probably have to be comfortable with
"adult themes".

On one hand this was just a old time murder mystery, but
on the other hand, this was a story of getting older
while never really growing up. A story about the long lasting
ripples in people's lives that result from tragic events.
Moreover, there is an interesting play between the power of
actions as well as the power of a lack of action. That not doing
something can sometimes be just as powerful as an overt act.

There are a lot of emotional issues at play in this book,
many of which relate to the mother-daughter relationship.
I did not feel a lack of understanding even though I clearly
lack any direct experience of this. Perhaps I just find it
easier to empathize or understand people who are a little
on the messed up side of life.

I won't give anything away, but similar to *Gone Girl*, *Sharp Objects*
has a lot of twists and turns, and what I would call a couple
surprises. Definitely hard to put down.
