Yet another Scot Harvath book from Brad Thor, [*The First Commandment*][fc-amazon] was just as good
as the rest. These books are a bit of my guilty reading pleasure so there is not much to say about
it.

One problem that annoys me with these serial books is the tendency to rehash stories from previous
books. I get why they do it because it allows someone to pick up any book in the series and not be
completely lost. However, I wish someone would just write a book series assuming you had read all
the other ones and just not retell things I already know. Maybe my memory for what happened in the
other books is better than other people, but it still annoys me.

As with the others, if you are in to outlandish thrillers involving terrorists and whatnot, then
this is another good read.
