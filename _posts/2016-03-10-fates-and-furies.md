[*Fates and Furies*][fates-amazon] is yet another work of
literary fiction with a dramatic amount of metaphor and flowery
language. This is a heavy book with a wide variety of twists
and turns and themes relating to belonging and loneliness. I definitely
recommend it, but it drags on at times in a flurry of pretense.

I had an idea for a book that I thought would be interesting. Tell the story
of a relationship between two people in two books, one from each perspective.
I thought the retelling of the same events from the two sides would be
fascinating. Turns out that this book is essentially just that, although
not quite exactly how I intended. It is more about two different ways of viewing
the world in general which just happens to be embodied by a husband and wife.

My main problems with this book revolved around my revulsion of most of the
characters as well as the overuse of descriptive language. I hated all
of the characters at one point or another. They were either unbelievable,
annoying, or just plain bad. They had their moments, and as a whole, they
fit together, but I still found it hard at times to read because I did
not feel for them. The other big issue relating to the literary style of
the book is common among literary fiction. There is a fine line between
compelling metaphor and an ostentatious display. Now the big issue with
complaining about this is that depending on your vocabulary you will complain
about such issues sooner or later. One who has no depth to their vocabulary will
often complain sooner that a book is being to showy, trying to overuse the
thesaurus. On the other hand, one with an extensive vocabulary will usually
only complain if the words are used incorrectly or if the writing feels off,
but they will nonetheless complain less about the use of language. My vocabulary
is somewhere in the middle, I look up a lot of words while I am reading.
I still feel that a fair amount of this book was extraneous, meant only
to show off or lengthen the novel for some reason. There was some great
imagery, and some great phrasing, but in the end I was annoyed a little too
often and it took away from my enjoyment.
