[*All the Light We Cannot See*][light-amazon] has been constantly
recommended to me, it was a top book of the year a couple years ago,
as well as a Pulitzer Prize winner. What put me over the top to finally
add this to my reading list was glancing at a few of the reviews for
*The Nightingale* which said this book was better than that one in
the genre of World War II historical fiction. To that point I think I
agree.

*All the Light We Cannot See* is supurbly written not just in terms
of prose, but in terms of style by mixing narrators and time in
an interesting and entirely clear way. I enjoy short chapters for whatever
reason, and this book basically had large chapters broken up into tiny
chapters which made the book easy to pick up at any time without having
to worry about finding a decent stopping place. I read this a little
slower than other books, which allowed me to really think about
what was going on a bit more. I think this helped me to really appreciate
the plot unfolding moreso than if I tried to rush through it.

All that being said, I do not really have a lot to say about the book
beyond that it was great. I did not really have too many deep philisophical
thoughts while reading it, at least to the point that I remember them
and want to comment on them here. I recommend reading the book, that is
about all I have to say about it.
