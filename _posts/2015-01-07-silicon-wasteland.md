I have recently become more disillusioned with the culture
around me and which I am a part. When I was working at
Facebook, I had metacognitive moments sitting in meetings
where people were discussing things like the text on an
alert telling people about their privacy settings, or
where people had trouble resetting their password, where
I just could not believe this was real life. Like these
people were being 100% serious about things that seemed
so absolutely ridiculous and trivial to me. But then I
had to remember that I had these feelings before and that
it was just the way that I viewed the world.

I have an inability to "take things seriously." By that, I
mean that whenever I am in a situation where others view
something as important, I am usually confused because I just
don't see what the big deal is either way. There hasn't
been anything in the past ten years or more where I've
had feelings like I have to be serious or something good
won't happen or something bad will. Someone died? I am
much more likely to just make a joke than say something
sympathetic, not because I'm a dick or I am covering up
something, but because I don't think anything is really
that important.

We live, things happen, you have to enjoy what you enjoy
while you can, but you can't take anything too seriously.
This point hit home for me really hard, when I watched a
show on HBO called "Planet Twelve: The Secret Life of 12-Year-Olds"
which is basically just following 6th graders around for
a week asking them questions about what is important
and difficult or good about their lives. It was eye-opening
because I remember being that age, and I remember feeling
and hearing some of the same things these kids talked
about it. I remember thinking that something was so important
that if it didn't go one way then my life was just going
be over. But when you hear the same things coming out of a
12 year olds mouth when you are 20, you realize how stupid
it sounds. How meaningless their "problems" are. But, I think
most people take this and turn it into, "oh geez, these kids
don't know what real problems are like the one's I have, when
they grow up they will realize how stupid those problems were
when they've got real adult problems to deal with." I have talked
to other people about this concept and that is usually
the gist of their reaction. My reaction was quite different.
Rather than making the same mistake as those 12 year olds, just
with larger problems, I took a step back and thought, maybe
nothing we think is important today really is. What if,
we realize in the moment, than in 5 years we will think
that the most important thing today is actually pretty
meaningless. Whatever it is, our future self will have resolved
it and we won't really see a direct link from that decision
to whatever is the next important thing at that point in
the future. Realizing that in the moment, we can then
have a larger view of the present that isn't overly
concerned with the mundane or even the exceptional.
Clearly there are some things that can be so life changing
that they are "important", for instance if you
are paralyzed or get a life sentence in prison. But I
would argue that even those things, as long as you are
still alive, after 5 years or so, you will have settled
in to a new routine and life will just go on for you.

With that context on why I don't take things serious,
I have to say that people in Silicon Valley have their
head's so far up their asses that what they think is
important, I don't think most people elsewhere in the
world would find important, but I definitely do not.
I hear people talking about how they believe they are
changing the world because they are creating an iPhone
app that lets you do, I stop listening at this point.
They pitch their companies with such highfalutin language
and attitude that I just want to vomit. Is Uber changing
the world? Are people's lives meaningfully different?
I would say technically the answer to the first
question is yes because the world is constantly changing,
and there must be some people whose lives are very
different now, but does it matter? I am disillusioned
by the concepts that people are getting off on.
I just don't get how people can wake up every day
and do what they do with a straight face. This is
not unique to tech or the Valley, but it is where
I currently live, where I work, and I think it is a
magnified here more than other places and industries.

I left Facebook for lots of reasons, but one that I
don't think I fully internalized at the time was what
I am talking about here. I didn't realize how large
this was and how much I didn't get it. I thought that
leaving a social network to go to a company that
was doing something real was the solution to my
philosophical ruminations, but I now realize that is
not the solution. My actual problems were deeper seeded,
I feel how unimportant things are, and even more
how ridiculous it is that I can live my life just
writing basically straight forward code. I actually
can't even find the words right now to say what
I really mean. There is just a ludicrousness to it
all that is eating away at me.

All of this has led me to think about other things
that I have always wanted to do, or what type of day
to day would be less absurd to me. It is hard to
say exactly what would not be absurd because it often
comes down just down to perspective. But, there is
one thing that I am seriously considering, which I alluded
to in one of my previous posts about a book that I
recently read. Nothing is going to change yet,
but I am thinking and we will see what happens.
