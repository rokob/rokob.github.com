I read *Red Rising* a while ago and enjoyed it enough
to put the second book in the trilogy, [*Golden Son*][golden-amazon]
on my reading list. *Red Rising* did not end with a huge
cliffhanger, it merely finished up it's story and laid
some foundation for what was to come next. Hence, I didn't
feel compelled to get around to *Golden Son* very quickly.
I am glad that I did eventually get to it as it was a pretty
good book.

My notion of what constitutes a good book varies based on
my expectations going in as well as the genre. I did not expect
an epic masterpiece when I read the first book in this series,
I was entertained but clearly it was never going to be some
monumental piece of literature. Thus, the second book, while
I say it was good, was good in the same way as the first. It
was an entertaining and easy read. There were enough twists and
turns to keep me guessing and interested. I know I enjoy
what I am reading when I tell myself just one more chapter, and
then I have to read two or three more because I need to know
what is going to happen next.

Unlike the first book, this book ended with quite the cliffhanger.
I will have to read the final book and pretty soon as I am curious
to find out what will happen next. There were some obvious twists,
but for the most part, the author kept me guessing where he was
going to take the narrative next. I wonder if they will make these
into movies, I have trouble seeing them done well because of the
wide variety of overly large and exotic things that are described.
For example, there are space battles and people of very different
sizes and descriptions that all would require a fair amout of CGI.
It could be done, but I fear if they do make these into movies they
will probably end up looking like shit not to mention having a great
deal of the story cut out because the entire books would be five hour
movies each.
