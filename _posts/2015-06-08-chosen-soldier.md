[*Chosen Soldier*][chosen-amazon] is an account of how the US Army
recruits and trains special forces soldiers. This was the state
of affairs as of around 2004 and the basic structure is still the same.
There is also a bit of history of special forces and unconventional warfare
in general.

The 18X program, which was created in the last 10-15 years, is basically
the equivalent of the SEAL challenge contract. Much of this book follows
a class of "X-Rays", as they are typically called, through OSUT, SOPC, SFAS,
and the Q course. The real training is done in the Q course. SFAS is the 35 day
selection course that determines who goes on to the main training course and who
gets dropped or recycled. Selection is what I have heard is the "toughest" part
of the entire program in that once you make it through that point your odds of success
dramatically increase. Clearly the whole program has varying amounts of
difficulty, but statistically selection is the weeding out point.

The book was well written and achieved its main goal of explaining how SF
training and selection goes down. Obviously, there are many parts that
had to be glossed over for security reasons, not to mention parts that are
continually evolving which implies that what you read today is not
necessarily what one would go through tomorrow.
