Everyone in Silicon Valley has been talking about Peter
Thiel's book [*Zero To One*][zero-amazon], so I had to
add it to my list. I just finished it and I think it was
quite good. It was overhyped in my opinion, maybe that is
just a product of who I have been talking to, or maybe
it just isn't the holy grail. Nonetheless, I recommend reading
it to anyone, especially if you are interested in starting
a company or interested in how technology companies rise
and fall.

I have a lot of thoughts about the book, most of them are
hard to put precisely into words because I did not take
notes while reading. One aspect that bothered me was the
presumption that economic theory consists of two models for
firms in the market: perfect competion and monopoly. As
someone who spent four years getting a PhD where I studied
exactly the area between these two, I may be biased, but
the common misunderstanding about what goes on between these
extremes and why is more pervasive than I thought. I just
assumed that people who spend time thinking about this stuff
would realize the very important world in this middle region,
but alas that does not seem to be true.

There is also an implicit assumption that colors the narrative.
This assumption is that building a billion dollar company
is what you should want to do. Additionally, there is this
underlying current of loathing for those who don't have that
as their life's ambition. I felt like part of the book was
overly preachy to the segment of society that sees themselves
as the solution to all the world's problems. Maybe that is
why there is so much buzz in the valley over this book, because
it really strokes the ego of most of the people here.

However, the majority of the book is focused a bit more
tactically on how to build a company, and what questions one
needs to ask themselves to decide if their idea/company will
be successful or not. This was very well articulated and
definitely contained some ideas that I had never thought of
explicitly before. I don't really want to get into the blow
by blow account of what I thought was interesting or not, so
I will just leave it at that.
