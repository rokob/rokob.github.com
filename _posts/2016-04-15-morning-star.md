The third and final book in the Red Rising trilogy, [*Morning Star*][morning-amazon]
was equally as good as the first two books. None of them are liteary masterpieces,
but they are still quite entertaining and fun to read.

I enjoyed the first two and I had to wait a bit for the third one to come out so
I was pretty excited to see how things would turn out. Usually in trilogies, the
third installment is a let down because the expectations are built up and everyone
has their own idea of how things should end that no matter what happens you are
usually disappointed. I thought this series ended pretty much the only way you could
imagine it ending. Luckily there were enough twists and turns along the way there that
it did not matter that you knew in the back of your mind where it was going.

I have been reading much slower this year, mostly because I have been spending a lot
of my time doing something else. That being said, this is still a very quick read
if you want it to be. I definitely recommend this series if you are into scifi
and liked The Hunger Games. I would not be surprised to see these books turned
in to a movie series, although with all of the futuristic gadgets and spaceships
it might end up being a CGI nightmare.
