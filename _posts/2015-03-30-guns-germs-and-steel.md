One of the more eye opening books I have read in a while,
[*Guns, Germs, and Steel*][guns-amazon] is a look at why
some parts of the world advanced faster than other parts.
It is obvious looking around the world today that there are
countries with more advanced technologies, agriculture, and
germs. Moreover from history class you recall that europeans
were able to overrun natives all of the world as they colonized
the new world. What is not actually obvious is why? Why did
Spainards arrive in the Americas with germs and advanced
military technology that allowed them to conquer the natives
rather than the other way around? This book answers that question.

I really enjoy history especially the study of ultimate causes.
We know why the europeans destroyed the indigious people in the Americas,
they had more firepower, were resistant to certain diseases, and were
more organized. But that is not the ultimate cause. The ultimate cause
had to do solely with an accident of geography. Eurasia had a headstart
on food production and building resistance to germs because of the climate,
existence of easier to domesicate crops and animals, and a favorable major
axis. There are a few other reasons, and all of them are laid out in detail
in this book. The one answer thatis not true is that it is not that certain
people are less intelligent or naturally not as good as another. This book
is clear to dispel of this racist answer by providing a convincing case for
the real answer.

One issue with this book was that while quite interesting, it was still
pretty boring. I think this was mostly writing style and the tendency of
the author to repeat himself. After a couple hundred pages you get the point,
but he keeps hammering it home with more examples. While this is nice
to cover all the bases, it still made it somewhat difficult to slog
through to the end. Nonetheless, I recommend it to anyone interested in
world history.
