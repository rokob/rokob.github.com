I have been thinking about universal basic income (UBI) a lot lately, and luckily enough so have a lot of
other people. The New York Times book review had a review of two books about UBI, so I decided to
pick up one of them to further my interest. [*The War on Normal People*][book-amaz] has a subtitle
of "The Truth About America's Disappearing Jobs and Why Universal Basic Income Is Our Future" which
made me think it was going to be heavy on the justification for UBI. The book instead is more an
argument for why the author thinks "automation" is finally going to hit the economy in the next
decade or two and result in so much unemployment that a UBI, among other things, is necessary.

The books breaks down into three sections: what is happening to jobs, what is happening to us, and
solutions. The first section can be summarized as machines have already displaced a lot of jobs and
it is only going to get worse. The second section says the lack of purpose and income associated
with long term unemployment causes health and psychological problems that have already begun to ruin
society and it is only going to get worse. Both these first two sections have some fascinating data
as well as a lot of bleak news.

There is not a lot of positive outlook in these first two sections and rightly so. The unemployment
rate is farcical in that it does not measure unemployment in the sense that most people think of it.
A real measure which incorporates underemployment as well as labor market participation rates paints
a much more dire picture than the healthy top line number. He paints a dark picture of the future,
but more so rightly states that we are already in dark times. Take for example, 22 percent of men
between 21 and 30 with less than a bachelor's degree reported not working at all in the previous
year. If you think that the education caveat there makes that less strinking, consider that only 
about 32 percent have a bachelor's degree or more, so that means roughly 15 percent of the total 21
to 30 age bracket of men are not in the labor force. A lot of them are simply not looking for jobs
and therefore are not considered unemployed by the traditional metric. That is a crazy high number
that is only going to get worse.

The part I really came to this book for was the solutions. This is where I was a bit let down. It
read like someone who sat down with his buddies and just started throwing out some crazy ideas.
The part on UBI is decent, short and to the point, but I wish it had been expounded upon. The rest
of the solutions are just things he thinks would be a good idea with a smattering of referential
support. All of his ideas are relevant because they address real problems that need to be fixed like
giving people meaning in a post-work world and fixing health care. But nonetheless, it seemed rushed
and not really that well thought through.

Overall this was a decent book for understanding a bit about where we are and a bit about some
proposed solutions on the path forward. I am planning on writing something a bit longer on UBI so I
will have to get some more sources and I feel that this one will end up being not as good as the
other stuff out there.
