I started reading another book right after *Dune* but
it proved too dense for me to keep up my motivation to get past
the first third. What I read of this book was good, but
I just kept finding other things to do instead of continuing
to read it. This went on for quite some time and was exacerbated
by the fact that I got a new computer that was actually enjoyable
to use. So lo and behold I just finished my first book in
over a month and it was the sequel to *Dune*,
[*Dune Messiah*][mes-amazon].

*Dune Messiah* was different than *Dune* in many ways, but
in my opinion it was just as good. I found these two books to be
similar to how *Empire Strikes Back* compares to *A New Hope*.
The second book was darker and definitly had more of an open ended
ending that really makes you want to see how things will turn out
in the third installment. I want to say that I actually liked
the second book more than the first in a lot of ways. Overall, 
I think the first was better because it had so much more breadth,
which, while not often better, was done better than almost any other
fantasy book I have read.


Many people do not like *Dune Messiah* because of the antihero
status that Paul takes on. I heard that before reading this book,
so I was aware of the critque, and to be honest I did not really
find that to be a negative at all. The way I interpreted many
of the actions of Paul, were as someone who was trying to make
the best of a situation that he saw as inevitable due to his
oracular powers. There were things set in motion during the first
book that foreshadowed most of the outcome in the second, so I did
not really understand why people would say it took a hero and brought
him down. It is said that *Dune Messiah* is a cautionary tale of
the abuse and corruption that goes along with absolute power.
While I see this point of view, I actually thought Paul should
the inner conflict of someone with power that usually gets ignored
when you view such a person from the outside. If you only focus on
the Jihad in his name you do not fully appreciate the decision making
process he goes through nor the pain he feels for what goes on
around him. This was mentioned repreatedly in *Dune* as he tried
to find a way out of what he saw to be his fate. Therefore,
I found this to be a really fitting sequel as well as a great book
on its own. I am really looking forward to reading the third book.
