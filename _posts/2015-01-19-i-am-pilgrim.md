Focus is one of the attributes that I like most about myself.
It allows me to drop out of the rest of the world and engross
myself in a book for extended periods of time. However, it takes
a good book to keep me wrapped up, to transport me to it's universe
where I can start to imagine that reality as the true one.
[*I Am Pilgrim*][pilgrim-amazon] is a prime example of just such
a book.

This book is really quite good. Again, it isn't some deeply
artistic book, with complicated allegories or an overwhelmingly
emotional presence. No, it was just simply the type of book
that you can't put down. You just need to know what is going
to happen around the next corner. One book I really enjoyed
from my adolescence was *Rainbow Six*. What got me about that
one was how there were so many different story lines going on
at once that seemed altogether unrelated. If you haven't read
it, I am sorry to break the news to you here, but when all
of those stories collide, I felt one of those moments of awe
as if seeing someone perform a complicated athletic feat yet
make it look effortless. *I Am Pilgrim* wove a similar
narrative. I don't think it was quite as good in that there were
less stories going on, but the overall effect was similar.

This is a book about a spy chasing a bad guy to put it simply.
But, there was a lot more to this than just plain good versus
plain evil. There was nuance to the good that made him seem
less wholesome, as well as nuance to the evil that made you
feel compassion or at least an understanding of his motivations.
The reader is not forced to accept a clear, unquestionable
morality. Rather, the book seems to take the reader on the
journey with the protagonist, leading you ultimately to one
perspective on the events that take place, but nonetheless
giving you a sense of freedom.

I would recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers
and spy novels in general. Similar to Tom Clancy or
the Jason Bourne series, but much more modern and personally
a little more relatable.
