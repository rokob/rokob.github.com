[*Cryptonomicon*][crypt-amazon] was a long and at times convulted read, but
overall it was entertaining. Although the book was not ridiculously long (around
900 pages), it was long enough that it took me almost a month to read when combined
with my recent decrease in time that I can devote to reading. The book a week plan
took a serious hit in April because I only managed to read this one book. Hopefully I
can make up for lost time going forward.

*Cryptonomicon* is a mix of historical fiction and I guess you would call it science
fiction. There are things which did not exist when the book is written, such as crypto
currencies, which now make the book seem less sci-fi and more just alternate reality.
The narrative jumped back and forth in space and time across several different characters
which made for some mental gymnastic to keep everything straight in my head. As someone
who has at least a passing familiarity for information theory, cryptography, and other
mathematical and technical topics that were relevant to the story, I felt that the book
was very understandable and mostly believable. I can imagine someone who is unaware of
Alan Turing or the code breaking work that went on in during World War II to be lost
at times. Nevertheless, there is a lot of human interest to the story wherein the code
breaking is mostly part of the backdrop.

The book is full of foreshadowing which can sometimes be lame because either nothing
gets tied together well in the end, or everything gets tied together but hastily, or
the end is boring because the foreshadowing gave everything interesting away. This book
suffers from almost none of those problems. The author is very good to give just enough
information away to guide you towards what is going to happen, but not enough to take away
all the surprise. This is quite the challenge considering half the story takes places 50 years
before the other half. The end was not hasty like some similar books tend to be,
probably why it took 900 pages to tell the whole thing.

I would not call this book "great" in that it is not a must read for everyone. However,
it is on the border between good and great, and definitely something I would recommend
to anyone who is interested in some good WWII and cryptography related historical
fiction.
