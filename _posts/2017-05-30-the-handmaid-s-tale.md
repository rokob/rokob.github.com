Taya started watching the Hulu show based on this book, and before I wanted to watch it I had to
read the book, so I picked up [*The Handmaid's Tale][handmaid-amazon] and got to work. Due to recent
developments in politics, this book as well as *1984* are once again best sellers, and after having
read this one I can understand why.

This book makes you think about how
easy it can be to just go with the flow, but how dire the consequences of that path of least
resistance can potentially be.

> We lived, as usual, by ignoring. Ignoring isn't the same as ignorance, you have to work at it.

There were parts of the book written in a different style which seemed to signify a different
meaning. The parts at night were more loose and dream like, explaining what goes on at night can
feel that way. The ending was a bit weird, I had one interpretation of it that made me feel better
about it later on, but initially it was annoying. I highly recommend the book, and now I can watch
the show.
