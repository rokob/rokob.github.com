I am planning on expanding on this post when I get a little more time later,
but I wanted to get it started. I will remove this disclaimer after doing
that.

My New Year's resolution for 2015 was to read a book a week. I was successful
in doing this in total, even though I did not follow a linear path. As you can
see in this chart:

<div class="chart"><div class="bar bar-7"><span class="text">Jan</span></div><div class="bar bar-5"><span class="text">Feb</span></div><div class="bar bar-5"><span class="text">Mar</span></div><div class="bar bar-0"><span class="text">Apr</span></div><div class="bar bar-5"><span class="text">May</span></div><div class="bar bar-7"><span class="text">Jun</span></div><div class="bar bar-9"><span class="text">Jul</span></div><div class="bar bar-1"><span class="text">Aug</span></div><div class="bar bar-0"><span class="text">Sep</span></div><div class="bar bar-2"><span class="text">Oct</span></div><div class="bar bar-4"><span class="text">Nov</span></div><div class="bar bar-9"><span class="text">Dec</span></div></div>

Each bar represents the books I read in a given month starting last January
where I read 7 books, and ending in December where I read 9. As you can see,
I had a couple months where I did not manage to finish a book, even though
I was usually reading during that time. My peak books finished per month was
9 which happened twice, in July and December. As part of this blog, I have
a script I use to generate the skeleton of a post, but I also use it
to generate some data about the books I've read based on the tag system
I have been using. Here is the raw data:
