Another suggestion from Amazon's list of best books, [*Station Eleven*][book-amaz] is a story about
humanity and civilization. The setting is before, during, and after a pandemic that wipes out the
majority of the population and therefore brings our modern world to a halt. The narrative jumps back
and forth across time and between narrator in a style that worked for me. Overall a good book that I
would certainly recommend, but which I found lacking due to the span of time and potential to
explore this future world.

I find it hard to fault a book for not spreading itself thin to cover all of the different
interesting facets of this post-apocolyptic world it created it. Nonetheless, there are so many
questions left unanswered. In itself that is the point. When the world crumbles, we are left as
individuals to hold on to what we were or make something new of ourselves. Those living through this
collapse are also suffering from unanswered questions, hope and deinal which eventually lead to
acceptance. The focus on one set of characters woven from decades before to decades after the event
leads to a sense of being one of them. You only know as much as they do and therefore that sense of
not knowing is felt alongside them.

Parts of this story were particularly interesting to me after reading [*The Great
Leveler*](/book/2018/02/26/the-great-leveler.html). I had all of these thoughts about how this flu
was affecting wealth distributions and income inequality. This book took the flu lethality to the
extreme, worse than anything in history, so that the destruction was almost complete. The largest
grouping of people that we hear of is a few hundred by twenty years after. That sort of decimation
would obviously lead to a leveling of inequality. I had feelings like this was almost too extreme of
a scenario for the real interesting parts to play out. I was hoping for more tribal issues or
rebuilding efforts. While there were hints of these themes, they were mostly missing.
