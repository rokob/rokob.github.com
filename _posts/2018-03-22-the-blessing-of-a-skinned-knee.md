[*The Blessing Of A Skinned Knee*][book-amaz] was recommended by our future pediatrician. In many
ways it is a book about living a Jewish life and how that applies to situations involving children.
In other ways it is just a pretty good parenting book that uses Talmudic thought to ground the
reasoning behind certain ideas. Overall this was a very interesting book when you take from it what
you want even if you don't want to go too deep into Jewish theology.

As a short read with good tips I would certainly recommend this. It brought up a lot of thoughts
about potential scenarios in the future and how I might react.
