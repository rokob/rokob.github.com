I have always been interested in the criminal justice
system both from a fiction and non-fiction perspective.
[*Forensics*][forensics-amazon] is a non-fiction book
about the various forensic sciences written by an
author of fictional crime stories. It is basically
a series of anecdotes, interviews, and case studies
about a variety of different techniques used to catch
and prosecute criminals.

I thought this book was just okay because there was a lack
of depth. Specifically, I wanted to hear more about specific
techniques and methodologies at a more detailed and scientific
level. As it stands, this is a survey of what exists at the highest
level, with an example case or two that demonstrates where the
technique was first used or where it was very important to the
outcome.

One strange aspect of this book for me personally was that
the author is British and therefore most of the examples
are in the UK legal system. I say this is strange because
there is quite a bit of difference between the UK and US legal
systems as well as how juries react to certain evidence.
Therefore, I think it would be interesting to find examples
strictly from the US legal system that are parallel to the ones
in the UK in this book. The forensic techniques are basically
the same so for that purpose the setting did not really
matter.

After reading this book, I may look into more detailed books
that focus on one or two of the different forensic sciences alone.
All that being said, if you want a quick overview of the reality
behind shows like CSI and Law & Order, then this is definitely
something good to pick up.
