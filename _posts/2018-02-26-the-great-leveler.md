Continuing in my reading trend of all things about inequality, [*The Great Leveler*][amaz-level] is
a history book attempting to find causes for how income and wealth inequality have been reduced in
the past. Ideally this would be some noble cause that leads to a policy recommendation for how we
can address the current state of increasing inequality. But alas he finds that the only consistent
causes of reduced inequality of any noticable scale were the result of violence. The more violent
the compression.

I highly recommend reading both this book as well as [*Capital in the 21st
Century*](/book/2017/01/23/capital-in-the-twenty-first-century.html) with the latter being first. It
is important to understand inequality both in income and wealth, both historically and currently,
and across different countries before one asks how this has changed. Piketty's book will give you
that foundation in the numbers based on the best currently available data. Whether you agree with
him or not is irrelevant, the presentation of the data is all that is important for this particular
book.

Summarizing this book is actually somewhat easy. First, one needs to understand that there is a
limit to inequality dependent on how much surplus exists beyond the minimum amount of income
required to keep people alive. Therefore looking at absolute inequality or the quality of life of
people at the bottom over different periods in time can be misleading. Second, wealth and income are
two different things and inequality can exist in both, one or the other, or neither within the same
society. It is rare for them not to be somewhat linked, but it is feasible depending on a lot of
different economic factors. Nonetheless the distinction is not all that important for the broad
strokes of the argument.

With that out of the way, there have only been a handful of periods in history where
societies have moved from high levels of inequality to low levels of inequality (where high and low
are relative). All of those times have had an a precipitating event or events that was violent in
nature. There have been periods where inequality has shifted peacefully but it has either been very
minimal in degree or it was shortly reverted due to some violent backlash. Moreover, the extent of
the violence goes hand in hand with the extent of the leveling.

There are four main sources of leveling in history: mass mobilization warfare, revolution, state
collapse, and epidemics. Mass mobilization is speficied with war as typical war that does not
involve the entire country mobilizing all of its resources to the effort has not had equalizing
effects.

The downside to this observation is that nothing else has ever worked. Moreover we are moving
towards increasing inequality. Hence, we are going to keep getting more unequal until something
violent happens. The scale of that violence would have to be unprecedented because of the current
structure of our modern economies.

He does go in to why we have inequality in the first place and to a limited degree discusses whether
this is good or bad. First,

So inequality comes from actual economic progress but also from predatory behavior. The predatory
behavior does not have to be obviously negative, but means basically rent taking in economic terms.
This can manifest for example in CEO compensation growing beyond any reasonable link to economic
development beyond their ability to extract that extra rent through whatever means they have
available.

The future does not look bright.

I found one line particularly fascinating

> higher schooling premiums are associated with lower intergenerational earnings mobility

This means that if you live in a country where the return to an additional year of schooling is
high, there is less likelihood for children to end up in different income brackets than their
parents. This is the opposite of what one might naively expect. That is, a typical free market view
that everyone is equal to earn what they work for would say that if I study and go to school and
work hard then I have just as much chance to make money as anyone else who also does. The idea being
that if I put more time into school so that I get paid more for my more schooling then children in
lower economic classes just need to stay in school to move economic classes. But that is so
blatently false based on the data and moreover in the US in particular where the schooling premium is
quite high, the level intergenerational mobility is laughable to the point that anyone who believes
America is an equal playing field is delusional.
