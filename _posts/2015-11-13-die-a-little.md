I happened upon an [article in Slate][slate] that basically says
adults should read books for adults and should be embarrassed about
reading young adult (i.e. children's) books. I understand this sentiment,
but I enjoy a fair amount of books written for young adults. I am thus
somewhat torn when I pick up something like the *Hunger Games* because
I have a nagging feeling like I should not be reading it. I should say I
used to feel that way, I have evolved to not give a shit about what I
should or should not be reading. I read whatever I think I will enjoy,
regardless of who is the target audience. My bigger issue is that books
for children have become popular recently so when I go look for books to
read or look at lists of books I don't usually find "adult" books. So I
went looking for adult books to read and it was hard to just find something
that was specfically for adults. This is clear in retrospect because a book
is for whoever can read it, digest it, comprehend the meaning. Shakespeare
could be for children because they can certainly read it, but it takes a bit
of maturity to really comprehend and digest what is going on. After all that,
I found a mention of the author Megan Abbott in the aforementioned Slate article
which led me to pick up her book [*Die a Little*][die-amazon].

*Die a Little* reminds me of film noir, which apparently is a genre
known as hardboiled fiction. I found this to be a good book, better than
a lot of other crap out there, but nowhere near the great category. The characters
in this book were developed just enough to be understood but not too much
to be boring. The narrative moved along at a reasonable pace weaving enough
twists and turns along the way to make it hard to put down. Overall it was
a short, page turner that falls into that category of women being abused by
men and crimes involving women that I keep falling into reading. I really
have reasons to pick these up and they just happen to fall into that category.

I may pick up another book by Megan Abbott later as she apparently has others
which are better, but I am going to steer clear of that genre for at least
one or two books.
