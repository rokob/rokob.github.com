Winner of the Man Booker Prize, [*The Sellout*][sellout-amazon] is an hilarous, irreverent novel set
in roughly present day southern California. This is really a hard book to describe. I could give you
a plot summary, but that wouldn't really capture what the book is about. The short version is that
you really should read this book, and let yourself laugh even if for some reason you don't think you
should.

There are so many good lines in this book, both funny as well as witty, for instance:

> Like Nazis at a Ku Klux Klan rally, they were comfortable ideologically, but not in terms of
> corporate culture.

If that doesn't get you to put this on your reading list then I do not know what will. I had never
heard of the Man Booker Prize, but after I did and I heard that this book one with an American
author for the first time, I figured I would check it out. I am really glad that I did.
