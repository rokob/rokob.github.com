Even though this book kept popping up on Amazon recommendations
and other lists, for some reason every time I read the description
I put off reading it. However, now that I have finished
[*The Nightingale*][night-amazon] I am sorry that I delayed picking
it up for as long as I did. This was really a moving piece of
historic fiction.

Although the themes of the book were very much centered around
the relationship between sisters and a girl and her father,
I still felt like I understood the emotion that was going on
between them unlike in some other books with similar themes that
I have read lately. The overall writing style was easy to read,
perhaps too simplistic if you want to be an ass and comlain about
something. Nonetheless, the writing did not feel juvenile nor
forcibly convoluted, it just seemed correct for this story.

There was a little bit of mystery in who was still alive
in the future, and who was going to do what when, that made
me want to keep going just to find out those answers. At the
same time, the story was enthralling enough to make me drop
other activities to find out what was going to happen next.

The last twenty to thirty pages are a real tear jerker. There
are moments throughout the book that tug on the heart strings,
but the ending is sentimental and moving in a powerful and yet
did not come across as sappy. That being said, the ending
felt a bit rushed, which I felt was a literary device to avoid
fully explaining some details of how the character's future
was really going to play out.

I highly recommend this book. This is not what I would strictly
call literary fiction as none of the characters are strictly
real, but the general themes of what was going on during World War II
seem to be roughly historicaly accurate. If you are a huge WWII buff,
I can't promise this will live up to your standards. But, for everyone
else, this is a quality story set during a tumultous
time in the history of France. There is quite a bit of romance novel
here as well if that is your thing, although I would not really put
this into that genre as I think it is a bit limiting in terms of the
real breadth of the story. Nonetheless, I would not be surprised if
a movie adaptation of this book cuts out a fair amount of the other
parts of the story and makes this into a more pure love story.
