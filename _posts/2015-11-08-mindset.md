Pop psychology books are usually not my bag, but I have had
[*Mindset*][mindset-amazon] lying around for awhile after
someone gave it to me and I finally broke down and decided to
read it. I am glad that I did read it because it actually opened
my eyes to many facets of my own personality as well as different
aspects of how people in general approach the world.

This is going
to be a longer post than I usually make about a book because
there is a lot more that I want to say after reading this than
with a typical fiction book that I have read. The short story
is that *Mindset* is overall a very good book because of the
ideas it contains. It is an okay book in terms of pure writing
quality because it is written like a typical book for a popular
audience. In other words, there are only a handful of main points
which are repeated over and over again with a lot of anecdotal
evidence. That being said, there are some real studies backing up
the points but obviously anecdotes are easier to digest. Also,
the handful of main points are pretty meaningful so it is worth it
to really read and interalize the whole thing.

The two mindsets that are discussed in this book are termed the
*fixed* and *growth* mindsets. The fixed mindset believes in statements
such as

> Your intelligence is something very basic about you that you can't change very much.

> You can learn new things, but you can't really change how intelligent you are.

> You are a certain kind of person, and there is not much that can be done to really change that.

> You can do things differently, but the important parts of who you are can't really be changed.

The growth  mindset believes in statements such as

> No matter how much intelligence you have, you can always change it quite a bit.

> You can always substantially change how intelligent you are.

> No matter what kind of person you are, you can always change substantially.

> You can always change basic things about the kind of person you are.

I have found that one difficulty that arises when discussing this topic is basically
semantics. Some people have a certain definition of intelligence as that part of
you that is fixed and you are born with. Then they think that how smart you are or some
other word is how much of your innate intelligence you are using. In other words, they
get really hung up on the word intelligence as they think it means something that cannot be
changed even if they more or less agree with the sentiment of the growth mindset. So if you
are one of those people, replace intelligence with whatever word makes you comfortable and that
has the meaning of your mental abilities as they pertain to solving problems and/or understanding
increasingly complex ideas. The basic tenet is that the fixed mindset believes that people are
born with a fixed set of skills and no amount of studying, effort, etc. is going to materially
alter that reality. The growth mindset, on the other hand, believes that we have essentially
unlimited potential and thus our skills can continually improve based completely on how much time
and effort we are willing to devote to bettering ourselves.

I find that putting it this way causes most people to say well obviously I believe you
can get better at things if you work at them. But the subconscious reality is that many
people do not truly feel that way. This manifests itself in many ways which are described
in the book, but one clear example is when people do poorly on a test and subsequently put
in less effort as they feel that one exam defined who they are and no amount of work
will substantially change that. People are then afraid of taking exams or when they do
they always have the excuse that they did not study to fall back on.

I have a growth mindset, or at least I have always seen myself that way. Reading this book
confirmed that I do have a growth mindset in many facets of my life, but what was especially
interesting to me was my realization that I have a fixed mindset for some aspects of life
which is totally crazy because it just lives right alongside my extremely growth minded view
in other areas. The five big areas of life where mindset is clearly a factor are:

* Intelligence / Mental abilities
* Sports / Physical abilities
* Business
* Relationships
* Teachers

Obviously there are others as well as crossover between these, but *Mindset* seems to call
these out as the different areas where research has been done.
