Pop psychology books are usually not my bag, but I have had
[*Mindset*][mindset-amazon] lying around for awhile after
someone gave it to me and I finally broke down and decided to
read it. I am glad that I did read it because it actually opened
my eyes to many facets of my own personality as well as different
aspects of how people in general approach the world.

This is going
to be a longer post than I usually make about a book because
there is a lot more that I want to say after reading this than
with a typical fiction book that I have read. The short story
is that *Mindset* is overall a very good book because of the
ideas it contains. It is an okay book in terms of pure writing
quality because it is written like a typical book for a popular
audience. In other words, there are only a handful of main points
which are repeated over and over again with a lot of anecdotal
evidence. That being said, there are some real studies backing up
the points but obviously anecdotes are easier to digest. Also,
the handful of main points are pretty meaningful so it is worth it
to really read and interalize the whole thing.
