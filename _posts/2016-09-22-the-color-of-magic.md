I was recommended to read one of the books in this series, so I chose the first one,
[*The Color of Magic*][color-amazon]. It is super weird. I am not really sure how I feel about it to
be honest. There were large chunks that just made no sense. I mean that I understood what the author
was trying to do, but the random introduction of arbitrary concepts did not add to my enjoyment of
the story.

The book as a whole is a decent read if you do not have anything else to do and you do not mind
strange scifi. I think I need to read some more of the books in the series to get a more accurate
feel for what is going on. However, parts that were probably meant to be clever and original I found
to be blaise. I recommend a lot of other books before this one, but I would not go so far as to call
this bad.
