I really need to stop reading books about families
with dead daughters. I have read 8 books so far this
year and 3 of them have their main plot centered around
young girls dying. I had reasons to pick these all that
were independent from reading their descriptions, but
I think I might start reading the descriptions before
adding more books to my reading list going forward.
Not that these were bad, I just need a change of pace,
because they are starting to get depressing. The third
such book I have just finished is called
[*Everything I Never Told You*][everything-amazon].

This book was pretty good. Many different themes were
explored and were handled really well. These themes
include: feeling different like an outsider either
due to race or other factors, feelings of obligation
and subjugation to what others want you to be at the
expense of your own wants and needs, feelings of living
an unfulfilled life where your dreams never come true
because life gets in the way, how communication or
the lack thereof can be so paramount to how relationships
evolve, likewise how sometimes things not said can be
more important than everything that is said, and of course
the lack of control and loss that people feel when they
lose a family member.

Personally, this book made me think a lot about not
living someone else's life and not letting inertia take
you to a place where you look back and feel disappointment
and regret. The mother in this book really exemplified
the negative impact of overbearing parenting from both
her mother's treatment of her as well as her treatment of
her daughter. It is always crazy when someone tries so hard
to be the opposite of what they despise and they turn
out to be the same in different clothing. This is often
my opinion about extremist ideologies. Replacing one word for
another, for example, the state in place of god, and you trade communism
for religious zealotry, and they hate each other fiercely, yet
they are really just the same thing. You hate how your mother
tried to force you into just marrying a Harvard man and
being a good homemaker, so you force your daughter into
being a doctor like you wanted but failed to do because
you had your daughter instead. The wheels keep turning around
the same way even if the tune is different.

I would not recommend reading this book immediately
after reading [*See How Small*] like I did, but in general
I would recommend this book. It is mostly depressing, but
I feel it has an honesty and realism that shine through
to make it hard to put down.
