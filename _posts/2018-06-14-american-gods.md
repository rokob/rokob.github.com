[*American Gods*][book-amaz] made its way on to my reading list again for some unknown reason. I
think someone asked me if I liked Neil Gaiman and as usual I said "Who?" This is a road trip book
at its core as well as a book about American culture.

I enjoyed this book, it was well written and had a fun story. I really did not enjoy the chapter
lengths. For some reason, I read books with long chapters really slowly. I have a feeling it is not
the chapter length per se, but rather long chapters are indicative of the flow of the story. If you
can't tick off landmarks on a regular basis it usually means the story is complex in how it unfolds.
This definitely fit that bill.

I recommend this book, and I may pick up another Neil Gaiman book in the future, but it was
definitely a slog.
