Amazon started a program called [Kindle First][kindle-first]
where you can pick one of six books each month to get for
free. Of the six choices for January, I decided to pick
[*The Moonlit Garden*][moon-amazon]. I probably would not
have picked up this book otherwise, and after reading it
I would not really jump to read something by this author
again. Although the book was ultimately not bad, it was not
my style and I think the overall quality of the book was
mediocre.

*The Moonlit Garden* is essentially a novel about romance and
finding oneself with a treasure hunt as the driver of the
narrative. That description maybe oversells it a bit much as
even that sounds more interesting to me than what this book
turned out to be. I did find the book to be enjoyable in that
I was invested enough to want to find out how the mystery would
be solved. However, the writing was a bit disjointed, and
often times it lacked a clear audience. Some of the dialogue
sounded like it was written for children and then other times
it seemed much more for an adult audience. It really felt like
she wrote parts of this, and then lost some enthusiasm as she
had to finish other parts. Maybe that is just poor editing
which polished certain areas more than others.

If you have a thing for female narrators going on adventures
and talking about their feelings for some guy she barely knows
then this book might be for you. Otherwise, I would probably
skip it.
