The movie Fight Club was good, but I always heard that
I should read [*Fight Club*][fight-amazon] as it was
much better. Typical. In fact, this is such a universal
fact that the only reason I think people say "the book
was better" anymore is to prove they read or to establish
themselves as somehow above the normal movie going masses.
Was the book better than the movie? Yes, no, it was the same
basic thing, but when your imagination gets to fill in gaps
that come pre-packaged in the visual format of cinema you are
left feeling like this is more satisfying because I was part of
the creative process.

I do not want to get into a seemingly Ballardesque review of this
book (a term I just found out existed), that would be too easy.
It would be too easy to complain about society and especially
the stature of man today compared to yesteryear. However,
I will say even though I am not nihilistic (most of the time),
nor would I completely try to force this book into that philosophy,
I will say it is definitely worth the read.

My preference for writing style (or is it reading style) has been
evolving the more I have been reading, but books like *Fight Club*
have always caught my attention. Books with an interesting rhythm,
a complicated plot, characters with witty lines, but even more
a bit of meta-wittiness that is somehow condescending of the book
itself from within itself. It is difficult to pull off without coming
across as derivitive. I find that to be the problem with most
modern art, everyone is trying to be original, you cannot be accepted
by doing something good within someone else's style even if the piece
of work is enjoyable. Somehow everything has to be important.
*Fight Club* could be original if you have not read anything else
that is similar before, it could be derivitive if you chose to overanalyze
it along with many other works in the fucked up world genre, or you
could just lay back and enjoy it and stop being an asshole that tries
to force everything into either the genius or crap categories. It's a great
book and a great movie. I look forward to reading more by Chuck Palahniuk.
