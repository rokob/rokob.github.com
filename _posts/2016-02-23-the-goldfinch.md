I was in an airport bookshop and saw [*The Goldfinch*][gold-amazon]
on the shelf. I picked it up and glanced at the back cover, decided
that yes I would like to read this but based on it's heft not on
this trip. My Kindle has been the sole source of my reading for
quite a while now, so picking up a random book to lug around on
a trip just didn't make sense. I added it to my wishlist and I finally
got around to finishing it now. It took me three weeks to work through
both because it has heavy prose as well as my preoccupation with
other endevors.

Within the first 10% of the book I knew this was going to be something
I would enjoy. The style is exactly the kind that I have found myself
enjoying. This is truly a great book. That being said, there were
plenty of times where I got overly annoyed with the main character for
being such a little bitch. Not only that, the philisophical theme
that this ends on is nihilistic to the point of despression. Much
of the emotional response that I had throughout the book was not
what I would call happy or good, but nevertheless it was a captivating
read and one that made me think and feel.

To be honest, the longer the book, the harder it is to write these
reviews or whatever they are. There is so much that I could talk about,
different thoughts I had during different parts, characters that I did
and did not identify with, but it seems unfitting to just talk about
some of it and not all, and therefore I feel it better to just not
say much. I highly recommend this book, it is worth the length
if you are a fan of stylistic fiction. I certainly felt like this
could have easily lived in another time period rather than being
written in the past few years. That is, a lot of modern literature
sucks, this is more inline with what I would expect out of classical
literature.
