I read *Everything I Never Told You* and *The Girl on The Train*
for whatever reasons (I think because of some Amazon list), and hence
[*A Small Indiscretion*][small-amazon] was also recommended. They
are similar in style in that they have female narrators with
failing or failed marriages that are driven either by personal
failures or stress induced by an incident with their children.

I really would not say that I am super into this genre, but I
have to admit I found this book, like the others, to be an enthralling
read that kept me engaged as I really wanted to find out what
would happen next. It was surely entertaining in that sense.
On the other hand, I can only read one book like this with many others
as buffer in the middle because the amount of whining, self-loathing,
and weakness is quite draining. I find it hard to identify with these
characters just because they are so morally shallow. But, if
you can work past some of that nonsense, you might find it to be a
decent page turner.
