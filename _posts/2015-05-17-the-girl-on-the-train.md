The Amazon lists of top books seems to be a bit hit or miss with me, but
more hit than miss. [*The Girl on the Train*][girl-amazon] is definitely a hit
on the list of top books currently on Amazon. The generic summary hooked me
enough to add it to my list and I am happy that I did. You can think of this book
as something like Gone Girl set in England, but clearly altogether different. There
is a missing woman and some twists and turns, otherwise it is basically not similar.
Nonetheless, I enjoy books that treat me like an adult and don't try to overexplain
simple things, or that give things away too early.

I didn't really get too much out of this book in terms of something provocative to
think about, but I was entertained. I am usually disappointed in narrators that are
weak, as this one clearly was. It is tough for me to identify with their whining and
complaining. For some reason, many books have highly flawed protagonists nowadays. I am
not sure if this is a trend in modern literature or just something I am noticing more
often that was always there if you read the right (or maybe wrong) things. I still
clearly recommend this book, but beware that the main character can be a bit trying
at times.
