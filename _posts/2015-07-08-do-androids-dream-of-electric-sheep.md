Another science fiction book, another one in the class of important
scifi books, but this one,
[*Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*][androids-amazon], I think
is very good, unlike my opinion of *Neuromancer*.

I decided to read this book because it is well known as one of the
better sci fi books out there, not to mention Philip K. Dick is considered
one of the better authors of the past 50-60 years or so. I also knew
that it was the basis for the movie Blade Runner, which I saw a long, long
time ago and have been meaning to watch again. I figured I would read the
book before watching the movie again.

There is good character development, an interesting and novel plot, and
enough twists and turns to keep one interested. It is a good book in itself
but even more so within the sci fi genre. I think I will probably try
to explore more of Philip K. Dick's books.
