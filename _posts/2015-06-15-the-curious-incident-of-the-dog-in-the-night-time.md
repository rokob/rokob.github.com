There has been an increasing amount of discussion
and interest in what is now known as the Autism
spectrum, which includes Asperger's syndrome.
[*The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time*][curious-amazon]
is a piece of fiction written as if the author/narrator is
a teenager with Autism. He is pretty far to one end of
the spectrum where he has violent reactions to being
touched and similar behaviours that are atypical in most
of society. The other end of the spectrum has people
who have been able to learn more about people's emotions
and societal norms which enables them to emulate those
behaviours and hence fit in.

I found this book to be very interesting. It was a good
story first and foremost. There were some plot twists,
a decent amount of character development, and generally
the writing was clear. One has to take into account the
way someone with Autism thinks in order to really appreciate
the book. I found the view into this kid's mind to be
enlightening. As his thought process is quite logcial and
fact based, it was quite easy to read this book very quickly.
