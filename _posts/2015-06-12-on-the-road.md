I don't completely know what to say about
[*On the Road*][road-amazon]. It was an okay read, although
I had trouble staying awake throughout as it was so random
and without any real meaning. This book did not differ from other
books that are considered "classics" but have been written
within the past 100 years or so, it was not good. The writing is
different, that doesn't mean it is good, it is just non-standard.

The beat generation was mostly a bunch of drug addicts who didn't
know what to do with themselves. I feel like every generation has
a feeling that they are different than those generations that came
before, and because of this they try to find themselves through
some kind of existential experience. The idea of this book is
that traveling and expressing oneself completly in all situations
is one path to finding IT. What is IT? Well you just have to know
right?

Seriously though, this book was mediocre, it was interesting only
in that it was original and is a defining piece of work of that
particular group of people within that particular generation. I am not
sure I would say that I recommend reading it if you are really looking
for a good read, but if you want to check something by Jack Kerouac off
your list then by all means give this a shot.
