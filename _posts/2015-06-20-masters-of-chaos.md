While reading *Chosen Soldier*, there was a reference to
the book [*Masters of Chaos*][masters-amazon] as a good historical
account of the missions of the Green Berets over the past 20-30
years. This sounded interesting to me so I put it near the top of my list.

*Masters of Chaos* presents a brief overview of the history of
the Army Special Forces, followed by a more in depth look at
the major conflicts they have been involved in since roughly
the late 1980s and continuing through the early 2000s in
Iraq. The breakdown of how SF was used in each of these conflicts
gives one a decent idea of how SF operates. It is clear where
their strengths and weaknesses guide many of the actions that
they participate in. Clearly this work only covers a subset
of the different teams and groups during different conflicts,
as well os only really covering actions taken during known,
overt wars and missions. But the general picture of fighting
by, with, and through foreign allies is overwhelmingly clear.

I also found this book gave a different perspective on the
conflicts themselves. There are definitely entire books dedicated
to each of the conflicts the US has been a part of over the past 30
years, but this gives a unique perspective through the eyes of
the SF soldiers on the ground. I found it to be an easy read, although
it was a bit disjointed at times seeming like a collection of stories
rather than a wholly coherent narrative.
