[*Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*][zen-amazon] is not
at all what I thought it was going to be. I had envisioned a book that
had some general wisdom veiled in motorcycle maintenance metaphors, I was
not expecting a full blown philosophy book. For much of my life, I have
been in the Aristotelian camp, but lately I have been broadening my thought
process because of a few points of life that still confuse me. This book
opened new doors that I did not know existed so it took me longer to
read and ponder, but I am quite glad I got around to reading this.

When I read paper books, I have never marked or highlighted them, I prefer
to keep my books spotless. One nice thing about the Kindle is that I can highlight
parts of the books I am reading without actually altering the book. I highlighted
more passages in this book than I think any other I have read on my Kindle before.
Putting those here I think is the best way to give an insight into what I
found meaningful in this book and also give a flavor to what this book is actually
about.

Some quotes I have comments about which are below the quote, some I just let stand on their own.

> The truth knocks on the door and you say, "Go away, I'm looking for the truth,"
> and so it goes away. Puzzling.

I thought this was quite true, sometimes you are so headdown in a problem that
you refuse to see the solution in front of you.

This maybe only makes sense in context, but basically the world was once devoid of rationality
and so people used rationality to explain the unknown, but we are not in a place where
rationality is so pervasive that people try to rebel against it without knowing that is
what they are doing.

I thought this was an eye opening way of looking at things. When you hear someone shouting
to the mountain tops about something, it is usually because they are also working on convincing
themselves.

This is one of the main points of the book and something I found quite useful.

This is even more close to being the main point of the book.

This felt right and reminded me a bit of *Fight Club*.

I found this pretty interesting because if you replace welder with software engineer or any number of
other jobs then this remains a very true statement. I am aware of it in the tech industry as I have
talked to a few people who essentially say exactly one or the other of these statements about
themselves.

Overall this book had a lot of quoteable parts and a lot of interesting perspectives on how to
look at different aspects of life. It made me think differently and that is probably the highest
praise I can give a book. I highly recommend the book even if you take a different view on
what he is saying as it gives you something to think about in a uniquely styled book.
