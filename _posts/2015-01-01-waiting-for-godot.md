Through a series of comedic errors I was recommended the play [*Waiting for Godot*][godot-amazon]
by Samuel Beckett. I had never heard of it before it was suggested to me,
and as I sat down to read it, I knew nothing about it. It was one of the worst
books I've ever read.

There seems to be a stereotypical depiction of the post-modern novel/play
among those who are anti-academic that is similar to the portrayal of modern
art as paintings of penises and eyeballs or performance pieces of a girl
having her period on the floor of a glass box. While this is certainly
true of a good portion of modern art, it misses the point. The point of
minimalist art is to evoke an emotional response in the reader/viewer. I believe
this is true of all art, but it is often the only quality of minimalism
because, well, there isn't anything else there. For instance, realist paintings
can evoke an emotional response, but they can also portray something real
as it is or as it ought to be. It is in this sense that modern/minimal art
is more subjective than other styles and really does require the clich√© of
beauty being in the eye of the beholder.

Unlike most visual art, literature also allows for people to read between
the lines and interpret what the author was really trying to say. This leads
to the world of comparative literature and the finding of meaning where none
was intended. Sometimes meaning really is there for the taking, other times
something is just so much gibberish that you can see whatever you want if
you stare at the tea leaves long enough.

*Waiting for Godot* is definitely in the category of minimal post-modern
literature which has been over analyzed to the point of insanity.
Hence, one could argue on one hand that my dislike of the novel is merely
my opinion and that the emotional response that others experience is unique
to them and therefore their opinion of the play as a masterpiece can be justified.
On the other hand, one could argue that I am simply not understanding the deeper,
allegorical tone, and that if I took the time to interpret the play fully, then
I would see it for the work of genius that it is. I disagree with both
of these sentiments, although I think that they are merely begging the question.

I would not recommend this play, it bored me, I found it's underlying theme
to be depressing and untrue, and I found it to be an ineffective mechanism
for conveying it's message.

I am trying to read more this year, so hopefully I will be writing more about
books as I read them. I am not writing book reports or summaries, but
mostly just my reactions to them, whether I liked them, whether I would
recommend them, and whatever thoughts they raise as I am reading them. This
was the first of the year, and it wasn't very good and it was very short
so I didn't even really have much extra thought going on. Hopefully these
become more interesting over time. More than anything, these posts
are a way for me to document what I read.
