I had heard about the story of Chris Kyle through various sources
over the past couple years, but I had never got around to reading
this book. The fact that the movie version is coming out
in a couple weeks spurred me to finally read [*American Sniper*][sniper-amazon].
It was a very good book, not necessarily what I would call a great
piece of literature, but it was well written, it had a
general overarching theme that tied together nicely, and most importantly,
it was clearly an authentic portrait of his life.

I have considered joining the military at various points in my
life, but for one reason or another I never did. This is the
first thing that has pushed enough of the right
buttons in my mind to seriously consider it again. I have my own
reasons, but hearing his process leading up to becoming
a SEAL, his personal motivations, as well as the stories of
fighting in Iraq, it was all actually pretty motivational.
I am pondering the possibility of how that might fit in
with the rest of the shit that I am doing, but to be honest,
it seems like a great thing to do right now.

One aspect of this book that really struck me was how much
he talked about enjoying his profession of warfare. Maybe it is
just because I haven't read too many military books that were
written by the actual guys on the ground, but this attitude
towards military action has always been how I thought I would
feel, but I've just never heard it echoed before. Clearly
there were moments of tragedy which are part of the reality
of war, but this book was the first that felt balanced to me.
This even perspective between both the potentially positive
and negative aspects of fighting our nation's enemies was
refreshing.

I am not sure how the movie is going to turn out compared to
the book. Sadly, he died before the movie was made, which meant
they reworked some of it to include parts of his life after the book.
Also, I have heard mixed things about the movie depending on
whether you know anything about realistic military training and
combat situations or not. As I do not, I feel the movie will not
strike me as too inaccurate, but as long as it is close to the book,
I have a feeling it will be pretty good. I will try to revisit
this after seeing the movie to see how they compare.
