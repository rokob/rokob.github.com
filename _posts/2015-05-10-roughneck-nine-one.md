It appears that I was able to make good on my hope that I would be
able to catch back up to my previous pace of a at least a book a week as
I just finished [*Roughneck Nine-One*][rough-amazon]. As I have found before,
it is much easier for me to stay interested and plow through a book that
I am really interested in. Roughneck Nine-One is about one particular
engagement of a special forces ODA during the beginning of the most recent
Iraq war. There is also some good color associated with their workup
as well as their analysis after the fact.

Special forces are an interesting group in that most of what you can read
about in the press or in books are atypical of their normal modus operandi
as they typically operate covertly. This book is thus only one side of what
type of action an A-team gets itself into. The fact that there were reporters
on the battlefield made this story easier to sell to the Army that it should
be told. I found the book to be an quick and interesting read. The writing could
have been a little better, but it was definitly functional.

I would not characterize this book as great, but it is clearly a good book in
the military genre. There are many books written about situations that arose
in Iraq and Afghanistan post 9/11, and this is a great entry in that list as
it is written by someone on the ground about a very particular engagement that
he was directly involved in.
