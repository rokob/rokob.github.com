Movies and books are often times two sides of the
same coin, but recently they seem to have diverged
to the point of being unrecognizable. If I can read
a book and watch a movie, both with different titles,
and only vaguely feel like they are connected by some
subject matter coincidence, then they should not be
considered the alternative media representations.
Had World War Z the movie had another name, I would
not have known about the book, but luckily watching the
movie did not spoil [*World War Z*][world-amazon] at
all as they share only a name.

*World War Z* is one of the best books I've read in a
while. Seriously, it is a very interesting analysis
of humanity when faced with the threat of extinction
at the hands of the undead. This book is a thinly veiled
piece of political and social commentary. While you might
disagree with how realistic certain situations might be,
or disagree with what is implied about humanity, the book
nonetheless is quite interesting and enjoyable.

On the other hand, World War Z the movie shares two things
with the book: the title and zombies. Almost nothing else
survives. Part of the bit about Israel overlaps but that
is basically it. I found the movie to be entertaining, but
I am very glad I saw it before reading the book. This is because
of *The Count of Monte Cristo*. One of my favorite books
of all time, so when I found out there was a modern movie
I was pretty excited; that is, until I saw it. The movie and books
again shared a title, the names of a few characters, and
a handful of slight similarities. But I found that movie to
just be horrible because of the expectations set by the book.
*World War Z* made into a movie true to the book could have
been awesome, just like *The Count of Monte Cristo* could be
an awesome (albeit likely 12 hours long) movie.

I don't understand
what goes through the minds of movie producers. Scratch that,
I understand it, but I disagree with it. My understanding is
that they are trying to appeal to the broadest audience,
spend the least amount of money, and make something passable
enough that it sells a lot of tickets. Okay, as a for profit
enterprise I guess that is reasonable. However, it robs
us of great, entertaining works of art. There is an implicit
assumption about the level of intelligence and attention span
of the average moviegoer that goes into the decision to make
a more action oriented film version of a book. Even though
this is true, the fact remains troubling.

My recommendation is to see the movie, and then read the book,
or just read the book. I found the book to be thoroughly readable
and entertaining, and yet still "deep" in some ways. If you
really concentrate on the reality of what a zombie plague could
do to the world, and then tie that back to an allegory about
the current state of the world, you are left with something
meaningful to think about.
