I have always enjoyed reading science fiction books, but for whatever
reason I sometimes disagree with the status quo when it comes to what
are considered the best books in the genre. I do not think that my most
recent read, [*Neuromancer*][neuro-amazon], is consindered to be the
best scifi book out there, but it is certainly considered to be a very
good book and an important part of the science fiction literature. It is
often citied as the book which introduced the concept of cyberspace and
starting the cyberpunk trend.

I thought the book was okay, I mean it was novel especially taken in the
context that it was written 30 years ago, but I would not call it great.
Much of it was rambling and incoherent. I understood what was going on,
as much as one can, and there were definitely some interesting bits, but
for the most part it seemed to be trying a bit too hard to be over the top
strange for the sake of it. I would like to read something else within the
same universe as there are some interesting concepts going on.

Ultimately the book was weird to the point of being unintersting and
dissatisfying. It was short, and there was enough to keep me going along
with the hope that something interesting was going to happen. There were
some interesting flashes, but overall it was not great, just okay.
