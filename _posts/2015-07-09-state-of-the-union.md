I decided to put [*State of the Union*][state-amazon]
on my reading list after reading a couple of the other
Scot Harvath books. I have to say the first two were
better than this one, but this one was still pretty good.

The premise of this novel was more far fetched than the others
although I guess in some way plausible enough after suspending
a bit of disbelief. I know so much of this book is not close
to being realistic but whatever it was still a quick, enjoyable
read. The one issue with this book compared to the first
one or two in the series is that it felt rushed. It was a bit
shorter than the others and everything wrapped up in a very
hurried way. I think I will still add at least one more of these
to my list to see if the trend in quality continues down or
picks back up.
