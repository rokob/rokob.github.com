Gillian Flynn has proven to be one of my favorite authors.
I have yet to read something by her that I did not like.
This short story, [*The Grownup*][grown-amazon], similarly
did not disappoint. It is a ghost story with her usual
twists and turns. I highly recommend it.

One thing I have learned about Flynn's style is that she
always has some big world changing twist near the end.
Sometimes that can go overboard like M. Night Shyamalan,
but somehow she manages to make the twists believable,
unexpected, and somehow necessary. That is, rather than
feeling like the whole book was jerking you around just
to get that twist, you feel as if the twist is very natural
and you are somehow stupid for not seeing it sooner. I think
this short story was different in that she pulled off multiple
twists in a quite small number of pages.
