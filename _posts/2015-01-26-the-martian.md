Somehow [*The Martian*][martian-amazon] ended up on my reading
list and I am quite happy that it did. I found it difficult to
put down, even more so that some of the other books that I have
been reading recently. From someone who is somewhat technically
inclined, the science seemed legit, at least to the point where
I found no trouble accepting the narrative. Combine the decent science
with the fact that the story was unique and humorous, and I have
to say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and I would
highly recommend it.

*The Martian* is a bit of futuristic Robinson Crusoe set on Mars.
There are twists and turns, with the majority of the narative
told in the first person by a man alone on planet Mars. This is
a cool setting with a lot of potential, and although the writing
didn't blow me away, it was sufficient to weave a compelling
tale.

I have a feeling this will be turned in to a movie, and I believe
that the movie will be pretty good. There were quite a few
moments of comic relief that made the book really stand out. Too often
sci-fi can come across as overly serious to try and make itself
more than it is. This book doesn't take itself too seriously,
which I think makes the moments of tension more believeable and easier
to swallow, because otherwise you wouldn't be sure when you
can relax. There are a few surprises which keep things interesting,
and seeing as it is a book, you kinda expect it to only end in
one possible way, but the journey is still a roller coaster.

Reading this made me remember how much I enjoy sci-fi and
the concept of space travel in general. I think I will have to
incorporate more sci-fi on to my reading list of the coming
months. I really like this idea of reading whatever I find
interesting rather than what I deem to be necessary. Each book
I read helps me to better understand what I like to read, which
further refines my future reading list. The feedback cycle is
pretty good. I am surprised one of my random picks has not been
"bad" besides the one I read because I thought I had to.
