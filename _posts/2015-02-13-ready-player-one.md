Rearranging my reading list to mix up the content and genre was definitely
a good idea. [*Ready Player One*][ready-amazon] got bumped up in my queue
because I really needed a fun book to break up some more or less serious
books that I want to read. I love sci-fi books even though they are always
dystopian. *Ready Player One* did not disappoint, it was a page turner that
kept me on the edge throughout.

I just realized it when I wrote it above, but all books about the future
seem to graviate towards the theme of something being build to make life
better which ultimately makes life worse. Usually it is some sort of
technology that leads the characters to the conclusion that the good ol'
days or the old fashioned way of doing this is actually the best. I would
really like to read a book about where we either don't progress that much
and thus the future is not too different than today, or where we build
something that just makes things better. Why not have conflict center
around some other aspect of life, but just happen to take place in a
future where cool shit makes life better and different? I have yet
to come across such a book, but hopefully one day. This book is dystopian
in that people escape reality into a virtual world to the point where
the world is falling apart around them and this just drives them further
into their obsession with the simulation.

I think the type of world that is described in this book is not too far
from the reality of the possible in the next few years. We are already
getting much better at VR, and based on the trends of computing innovations,
I would not be surprised to see something like what is described in this
book existing, at least from a technical point of view. Now whether it is
adopted at the scale as presented in this book, or if it has the secondary
consequences on reality that are preesnt here is a different question. One
could argue that we are already evolving into a world that is more disconnected
from reality. I think my perspective on that is skewed based on where I live
and work, because that does not seem to be the case in many other parts of the US.
But, nonetheless, this book make me think a little bit about the ramifications
of disconnecting from reality, both positively and negatively.

I definitely recommend this book to anyone of roughly my generation who
likes video games and eighties movies. I think it would be good for anyone,
but if you hate video games you might find it boring or hard to relate
to the abundance of references.
