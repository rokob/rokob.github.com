I think I ended up reading [*The Good Girl*][good-amazon] because it was on the list of free books
from Amazon for July or August. It was a decent book, at times trying way to hard to be better than
it is, but there was enough there to keep my interest and want to know how it was going to end.

The style of the book is where each chapter is set before or after Mia returning home and narrated
by one of a few different characters. You therefore have to piece things together from the different
time frames and perspectives with the final details being revealed very late in the book. This is a
somewhat standard formula now for these types of thrillers which does not really bother me. I am not
sure if I can say that I like this style per se, but it definitely makes what would otherwise be an
arguably boring linear narrative more interesting. In other words, I think it takes more work to
tell a linear story and make it captivating compared to jumping around between narrators and time
frames. There is a bit more work to be done by the reader pieceing together hints here and there
about what is going to happen. That being said, there is a certain amount of skill involved with
having some twists and turns throughout even though at some points you know how something is
generically going to turn out given that you are reading part of the book set after a particular
event.

I would not go so far as to put this on par with *Gone Girl*, but if you liked that book or *The
Girl on the Train*, then you might find this to be worth reading. In no way is it a must read, but
it should hold your attention for a few hours.
