I have always liked thrillers like *Rainbow Six* and
*The Bourne Identity*, so when I heard about the Scot Harvath
series, I decided to through the first one, [*The Lions of Lucerne*][lions-amazon],
onto my reading list. This was a really fun read that had me
excited about getting to the end the entire time. I am generally
impatient when I read in the sense that I want to keep reading
a book that interests me until it is over at the expense of doing
anything else. This book was no different.

*The Lions of Lucern* was not what I would call amazing by any
means as it did have some flaws. The plot was a little bit
contrived and predictable at times, and the personality of the
main character was sometimes ridiculous to the point of making me
say "you've got to be kidding me" out loud. Nevertheless, the overall
feeling of the book was enjoyable and engaging enough to push past
whatever flaws that do exist.

I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun thriller
that does not take things too seriously. By that I mean this is
definitely in the spirit of Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum so this
is not what you would one day call classic literature. I am looking
forward to reading some of the other books in the Scot Harvath
series at some point in the future.
