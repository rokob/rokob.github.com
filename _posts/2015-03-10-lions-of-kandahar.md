The Green Berets form an interesting part of our military. They are
the Army's tier 2 special forces operators analogous to the SEALs which
represent the Navy's tier 2 special forces operators. I have read about
what they do in theory but until reading
[*Lions of Kandahar*][lions-amazon], I did not fully appreciate their
day to day lives on deployment. The main distinguishing factor that
sets Army special forces apart is how they train and fight with
indigenous armies.

Working with the armies native to a country seems like a good idea
because they will be the ones left when the Americans pull out. This also
provides for an opportunity to help build a country up rather than just
tear it apart. However, from reading this book, it sounds awful. It is
crazy to put your life in the hands of soldiers with training that is so
far inferior to ours. I could see trusting the other special forces guys
around you because you have a shared set of training and experiences. But,
trusting the guys who may very well be spys for the enemy or simply run away
at the first sign of trouble, does not sound like a great way to fight a
war to me.

The book details a series of firefights that occured in the taking of
the city of Kandahar in southern Afghanistan in 2006. It was a very
good portrait into a crazy series of conflicts. I found it to be well
written and pretty engaging. I would recommend it especially if you
are interested in a some war stories. It made me realize that the Army
special forces is probably not the right place for me. I would not
completely rule it out, but based on how things operate in this book,
I doubt it would interest me day to day.
