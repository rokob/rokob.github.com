[*See How Small*][small-amazon] is Amazon's Spotlight pick for
January 2015, whatever that means. Basically, there was a list
on Amazon of books and I picked this one seemingly at random.
It was okay, not good, not bad, just okay.

The book has an interesting premise, crimes against little girls
seems to be a theme this January. The writing was trying too
hard at times to be overly literary. It was distracting from
the point and made it difficult to follow what was really
going on. Now I know that can sometimes be an artistic style, but
I don't think it worked that well in this book.

The worst part about this book is that it is almost like a
snapshot of some people's lives. There wasn't a clear
delineation between acts. No crescendo. No real twists
or turns. It was just kind of a slice of life with some
fucked up shit going on. Well I personally don't think
it is that fucked up, but most people who characterize
it as such.

I would not really recommend this book, unless you
are really bored and don't mind not really finding
any closure. I mean the main event that spurs most
of the plot is not even described well enough to
really get a full picture of what happened. The book
was more frustrating to me than satisfying. But, at
the same time, I wouldn't call it bad, it was still
a captivating read, even though I felt let down when
I was finally finished.
