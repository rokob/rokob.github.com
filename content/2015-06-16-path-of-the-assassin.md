After reading *The Lions of Lucerne*, I really wanted to
read more about Scot Harvath, so I followed up with the second
book in the series, [*Path of the Assassin*][path-amazon]. I
know these less-than-realistic military/spy pop-fiction thrillers
are what some consider to be non-intellectual reading, but I
really don't care. I really enjoy these books. They are fun,
they are easy to read, and they keep me engaged. Much of the
plot isn't too crazy, there is just enough realism to keep
things interesting.

I am looking forward to continuing on reading some of the
other books in this series. I am sure that *The Lions of Lucerne*
is going to be made into a movie at some point, so I am pretty
excited to watch that when it comes out in a few years. I think
this book was more fast paced than the first, but had slightly
less character development. Perhaps that was because many of the
characters were already described in the previous book. This was
also much more linear in terms of the story line, whereas his
previous book had multiple things going on at once that eventually
converged. Nonetheless, enjoyable read.
