Having children changes your outlook on life. [*The Last Stone*][book-amaz] is a true crime story
about the kidnapping and murder of two young girls in the 1970s. Reading such a book at a different
time in my life had a different feeling with a dispassionate distance. Now I found a swelling of
emotions when projecting those close to me into certain scenarios. It was unsettling.

This is a great book, but some might find it not much of a book and more along the line of
journalism. The majority of the book is a blow by blow accounting of interviews with one man who
starts out as a potential witness and gradually becomes maybe something more. There are a lot of
people involved in the case and to tell the truth not much by the way of answers. Certainly some
things are figured out and explained to us the reader, but due to the passage of time, some things
are lost forever.
