[*Give People Money*][book-amaz] is yet another book on Universal Basic Income. The writing is
decent, the range of topics is worthy, and if you know nothing else about a UBI or programs like it
then this is a great read. However, it is a rehash of a lot of things I already know and have read
from other sources so it wasn't the best book for me. I also think there are other sources which are
more in depth on some topics which is really necessary for getting in to some of the important data.
I am done reading these popular audience UBI books as I am not the target audience and I am no
longer getting anything terribly useful out of them.
