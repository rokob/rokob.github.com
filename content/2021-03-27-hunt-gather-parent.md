[*Hunt, Gather, Parent*][book-amaz] is the best parenting book I have read so far. It has many
faults and I don't think you should just follow her advice, but you should read this book if you are
interested in parenting philosophies. There are similarities to Emily Oster (*Expecting Better*) and
Pamela Druckerman (*Bringing up Bebe*) in style and content but it is unique nonetheless.

All of these books really want to give you some bullet points for you to put on your refrigerator
or talk about in a book club and I can't stand that. This book has an acronym TEAM which she uses to
guide you through different parenting styles around the world. It is worth it to explore these
different styles and understand what is possible to borrow from them.

My biggest issue with this book is the only superficial discussion of how these different parenting
styles are appropriate in certain environments but not in others. The ability to give young children
extreme amounts of autonomy is hampered by certain realities of modern cities. She also does not go
into some of the negative consequences in rural third world settings of that autonomy.

You should read this book, but it is okay to be critical of the prescriptions as well as flexible in
the understanding that rural Kenya and Santa Monica, CA have some differences.
