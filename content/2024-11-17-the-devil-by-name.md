After reading *Fever House* I knew that I would need to read [*The Devil by Name*][book-amaz] which
is the sequel. Like nearly all sequels, the most novel elements were found in the original and this
was clearly not as good. Nonetheless it was still a great read.

This was a page turner just like the original so I also read it quickly. However I did not read it
as fast as the first one because although I was interested to see what would happen next, I was
already slightly numbed to the insanity of the idea behind the two stories.
