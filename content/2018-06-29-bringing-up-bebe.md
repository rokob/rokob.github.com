[*Bringing Up Bébé*][book-amaz] is a book memoir combined with a book on parenting advice. The main
point is that the culture of parenting in Paris is different than in America. She does a good job of
distilling the differences down to something digestable and beyond anecdote from her personal
experience. There are reasons for why the cultures have developed certain attitudes towards child
rearing and these differences have an impact on the lives of both parents and children. Most of it
is driving a narrative that the French system is better, but there are some tempering points about
why things are not always "better".

It is not worth going through the book point by point, but there are a few high level themes that I
took away. The main one being that children are complex humans with rich inner lives. The American
way of viewing children tends to see them as not being too simple to have serious emotions and
viewpoints and that they need to be constantly coddled. Parents think they need to be constantly
entertaining and micromanaging children. The French view of children is that they need to be given
space and respect for their own inner selves to exist and interact with the world. This leads to
things like let children eat real food, make them eat in the same schedule as the rest of the
family, let children spend time alone, give children wide freedom while they are inside a well
structured frame (cadre) but be strict at the boundaries.

The other big point which I think might be difficult for me is to be strict. A parent must be the
one who ultimately decides and is the one who is firmly in charge. It sounds clear in theory, but I
can see how this would be difficult.

Overall I enjoyed this book, and I am sure I will go back to it and check some things out when I am
not sure why nothing seems to be working.
