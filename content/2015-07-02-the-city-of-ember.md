After reading a few young adult trilogies, Amazon
recommended [*The City of Ember*][ember-amazon].
This book was pretty similar to *Red Rising* and that
trilogy. This book was much shorter and less well
developed. It was a very quick and easy read,
and the foreshadowing was way too obvious. It was
pretty clear what was going to happen all throughout.

I would still recommend this book if you want to have
an easy read, or you have some other need to get in to
yet another distopian trilogy. I may read the rest of
the books in the series just to see where it goes,
but I can't say they are very high on my list.
