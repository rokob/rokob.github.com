[*Confronting The Classics*][book-amaz] I picked up because Taya had suggested that I might like it
given my recent interest in history podcasts, specifically Hardcore History. I did enjoy it as it
touched on some things that I have recently being learning about, but overall it was not that
exciting. It is a book of reviews which turned out to be a might meh for me.
