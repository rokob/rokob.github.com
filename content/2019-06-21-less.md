Halfway through reading [*Less*][book-amaz] I came to the conclusion that I don't think I have read
a novel before with a gay protagonist. I guess that says something about me, but although I might
have before, I have certainly never read something where the sexuality of the main character is
discussed so frequently and drives the plot and yet is not important.

I mean that the ideas of growing older and the changing nature of who we are, who we love, and how
the world sees us is a transcendent phenomenon. Nevertheless, this is a comedy that is clever if not
always laugh out loud funny. The fictional writer-cum-protagonist has his work described as
magniloquent which describes this book very well (after I looked up what it meant). I understand why
it won the Pulitzer Prize as the writing was some of the more enjoyable I have experienced in a
while, not withstanding the amount of words I had to look up to make it through.

I highly recommend this book. It is short but not a short read as the chapters are awfully long
which are difficult for me to fight through.
