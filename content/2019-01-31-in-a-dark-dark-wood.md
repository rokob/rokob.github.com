In the same general genre as *Gone Girl* and *The Girl on the Train*, [*In a Dark, Dark Wood*][book-amaz]
is a thriller with some violence and a few twists and turns. Set in England with a pretty heavy use
of UK idioms this was an enjoyable, engaging read.

The writing was subpar especially at the beginning where it was overly dramatic and the descriptive
imagery seemed forced. But as the action picks up, the issues with the writing recede. I would
certainly recommend this if you enjoy the whodunit genre, especially if you are one to read the book
before the movie as supposedly the movie is coming soon. Not as good as Gillian Flynn, but still
worthwhile.
