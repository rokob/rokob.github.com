[*Creation Lake*][book-amaz] was a shortlist finalist for the Booker Prize which has become one of
my go-to sources of great reading. I have read maybe five or six Booker Prize winners over the past
several years and they nearly all have been amazing.

I had no idea what this book was going to be about before reading it and I am kind of glad because I
am not sure I would have wanted to read it. That said, it was quite entertaining and very well
written. The book made it hard to put down as I wanted to know what was going to happen next, but I
also did not want it to end as it was both funny and emotional. It wasn't the best book I've read
this year, but it is something I highly recommend.
