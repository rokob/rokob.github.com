I enjoyed all the other Joe Hill books I have read so far, and [*Heart-Shaped Box*][book-amaz] is no
exception. This was a engaging and actually somewhat scary book. Scary in the sense that it made me
think about the possibility of ghosts being around us all the time in a real way.

I am glad I started reading his books and I am looking forward to the next one of his on my list.
