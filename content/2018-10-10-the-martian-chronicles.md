A classic sci-fi (although I think he classified it as fantasy) novel,
[*The Martian Chronicles*][book-amaz], is one that has always been on my
list but never rose to the top. I learned it was a collection of short stories that were turned into
something more of a novel after being put into something of a chronological order.

The book was good, not as great as I think people make it out to be. I had to remember the context
of when it was written to appreciate it because otherwise some of the novelty is lost with time. I
like Ray Bradbury of what little I have read, so I am happy I finally got around to this his first
novel.
