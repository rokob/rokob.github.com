The first I had heard of [*The Illustrated Man*][book-amaz] was in a reference on a tv show about a
dead body covered in tattoos. Little did I know that I had also heard a reference to one of the
stories in the collection from someone who did not know that the story was part of a collection.

The overall premise of the collection of short stories is quite novel and nearly all the stories are
great. Some of them don't quite hit the mark as there feels like too much overlap with others.
Nonetheless I felt like I really added to my understanding of the genre and furthered my
appreciation for Ray Bradbury.
