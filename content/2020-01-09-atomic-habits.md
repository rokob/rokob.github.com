I heard about [*Atomic Habits*][book-amaz] on a podcast I listen to and decided to give it a shot.
As basically a self-help book it is not bad. You have to suspend your intellect a bit when you read
a book with bullet point summaries at the end of every chapter, but it was still worthwhile. There
is a lot of repetition of ideas, not all bad. I learned some things and picked up many new
strategies for working on systems of habit formation.
