I think I heard about [*The Three-Body Problem*][book-amaz] on the A16Z podcast, but I do not
exactly recall. This was an enjoyable read, even more interesting because it was translated from
Chiense. There certainly is quite a bit of cultural difference that does not translate but I was
surprised how universal much of the book felt.

I might have to add the other two books in the trilogy to my list, but definitely not to the top. It
was worth the read, but not so good that I'm dying to keep going.
