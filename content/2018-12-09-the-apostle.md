[*The Apostle*][book-amaz] is book eight in the Scot Harvath series by Brad Thor. Not much to say
about this one, it was about on par with the other books in the series. Scot is no longer
working for the government, but the same shenangians as usual go on. Not the peak of literary
greatness nor realism, but a fun, quick read nonetheless.
