[*Full Black*][book-amaz] is the next installment in the Scot Harvath series by Brad Thor. I have
read all of them so far. They are pretty much all the same, not literature but quick, enjoyable
reads.

He has gotten worse at his characters having their own voices. There are many different
people who all sound the same to the point that when they have conversations with each other it
sounds awkward. He is also getting further into this dogmatic right-wing mentality that parts of
this book just sounded really preachy.

I will keep reading them because they are silly, but I
wouldn't start with this if you haven't read the previous nine.
