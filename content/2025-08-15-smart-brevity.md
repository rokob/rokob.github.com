[*Smart Brevity*][book-amaz] was recommend at work many months ago. I bought it and it has been
sitting on my Kindle until recently I decided I might as well give it a go. On one hand, this book
was amazing. It explanined very clearly a method of writing to get your point across effectively. On
the other hand, for a short book about writing less, it could have easily been half as long.

I am interested in using this style of writing in certain places. Clearly I am not using it here
while writing this. But I have already started using it at work a bit and it does work. I have an
idea for a separate blog I guess you would call it that I procrastinate on writing due to not
feeling like I have time. But my thought is to experiment writing in this style. Howver, the old
Mark Twin adage definitely applies "I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a
long one instead."

Let's see if I actually do this and how it goes. I already was thinking about writing something and
I realized the key to "Smart Brevity" is actually knowing what you want to say. It is easy for me to
write a lot even when (maybe especially when) I don't fully understand the point I am trying to get
across. Distilling your main point down into a single sentence requies you to know what that one
point is. So I am going to give this a go with the constraints defined in the book as a guideline.
