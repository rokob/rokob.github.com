I picked up [*Rejection*][book-amaz] last year but do not remember why and didn't manage to read it
unitl now. I think I went on a buying spree of random books from best book lists towards the end of
last year with the hope that I would read more this year.

*Rejection* is a collection of short stories, although they are all interrelated so it might be fair
to just call it a book with really long chapters. Quite funny, although somewhat hard to read with
vocabulary that required me to look up a lot more words than usual. A lot of cringey moments, but I
generally found the satire to be poignant. A lot of talk of this book call it disturbing, but as
someone roughly in the same age demographic as most of the characters I found it to be mostly just
hilarious.
