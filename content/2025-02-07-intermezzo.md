[*Intermezzo*][book-amaz] is a strange novel. It was good I guess but it was also awful. The writing
style did not work for me most of the time. At times I got into it and things moved along, but at
other times it just annoyed me.

The plot and characters were meh but it wasn't bad by any means. I think it just did not resonate
that well with me. Sometimes I felt connected, but mostly I didn't care that much. So overall I
thought it was okay but I wouldn't recommend it.
