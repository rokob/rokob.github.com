I took a pretty serious hiatus from reading. Part of it is the move, part is just being generally
busy with work and the rest of life. I started reading [*Klara and the Sun*][book-amaz] a couple
months ago but put it down for quite a while. I finally got around to finishing it and it was quite
good. It was original and thought-provoking, but spent too much time on minutiae with the all the
action packed into too few pages.

I do recommend this quite a bit. It is hard not to give too much away other than the robot concept
is executed well. I may have to go back and read more of this work as I think I only
skimmed enough of *Remains of the Day* to make it through the relevant tests in English class.
