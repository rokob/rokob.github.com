[*Black List*][book-amaz] is yet another Scot Harvath novel by Brad Thor. It was still fun to read
but they keep getting worse. This was did quite a bit of explaining away the core bad thing by
saying it doesn't matter how they really plan to do the thing because it will be bad if they do. I
don't recommend unless you are reading them all like I appear to be.
