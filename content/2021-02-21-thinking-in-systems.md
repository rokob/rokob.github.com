[*Thinking in Systems*][book-amaz] is a great book about, well, thinking in systems. I have never
heard of this field before which I am now realizing is kind of strange. It is basically differential
equations plus economics plus sociology, but yet none of those things. One should view the world as
more interconnected and complex than we usually do with the traditional reductionist way of
thinking.

I am going to be digging into this topic as a field more even though this is kind of what my entire
life has been about both in my education as well as work.
