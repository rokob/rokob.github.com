I am looking for things to read. Always. We subscribe to the New York Times to be delivered in paper
form on Sundays, I always go right for the book review. Usually there is something in there to make
me think about what to read next. I also periodically trawl through
[*The Paris Review*](https://www.theparisreview.org/), [*The New York Review of Books*](https://www.nybooks.com/),
and various [*Amazon charts*](https://www.amazon.com/charts/mostsold/fiction). I have yet to find a
definitive source of material. Although the winners of the Man Booker Prize have been a consistent
set of good reads.

I have [this Amazon list][my-list] which I constantly add books to and then buy five or six at a
time. The list is not really sorted, it is I think just based on when I added the books to the list.
I used to try to keep it in order based on what I wanted to read next. Instead I just look through
it whenever I am finishing the last book of my previous batch purchase and pick a few to read. The
consequence is that some things have been on there for a few years, languishing away at the bottom.

I don't trust best seller lists because they are a proxy for quality and tend to be not the best
proxy at that. People tend to buy what is on the best seller list, making membership on the list
almost tautological. Amazon does recommended books, and they know basically every book I have read
in the past few years, but it seems like their recommendations are boosting things they are trying
to push rather than doing a good job of collabrative filtering. I would like a search engine where I
can pick a few characteristics and maybe some other books that might be similar to what I am looking
for and it would give me ideas. For music I know of some work in this field doing acoustic analysis
of songs, but I haven't seen anything for books.

Last year I read a lot more non-fiction than usual. That might be a trend that continues as there
are quite a few non-fiction subjects I am currently interested in. However, I might do a better job
of throwing two to three fiction books in between each non-fiction rather than reading non-fiction
back to back.

Next up is *Iron Gold* which is the fourth book in the Red Rising series. That is the last in my
last group of purchases. My next chunk will be:

* *Foreign Influence* by Brad Thor
* *The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell* by Aldous Huxley
* *Ice* by Anna Kavan
* *Asymmetry* by Lisa Halliday
* *In a Dark, Dark Wood* by Ruth Ware
* *The Real Lolita* by Sarah Weinman

That has four fiction and two non-fiction. There are some really interesting books in that chunk
which I am excited about. The Brad Thor book is my guily pleasure, book nine in the Scot Harvath
series. The Huxley book is one I am surprised I haven't gotten around to reading before and is long
overdue. *Ice* comes from The Paris Review about lesser known female authors. *Asymmetry* is on a
few best of 2018 lists and sounded good. *In a Dark, Dark Wood* has been sitting on the bottom of my
list for a long time so time to pull the trigger. *The Real Lolita* I heard about on NPR and is
quite interesting, particularly because I had a weird interaction with the *Lolita* having decided
to try to listen to the audiobook. Hopefully this non-fiction book isn't as weird as listening to
Jeremy Irons talking about pedophilia while riding my bike.
