[*Never Enough*][book-amaz] came to me as a book that some people read as part of a discussion group
at school. I just got around to reading it now even though that group was many months ago. I am glad
I finally read it as it was a quick read and it was an interesting view into the culture of many
"high pressure" school settings.

I don't think I grew up with that much pressure, I never felt "stress" to do well in school. But I
did have some of the issues addressed here. I also see how it can be pretty toxic. It was very
informative for what to look out for. The writing style got a little tired and the whole book could
have probably been half as long, but I know that this is the normal style for this type of book.
Definitely worth reading.
