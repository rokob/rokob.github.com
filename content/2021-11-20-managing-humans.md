[*Managing Humans*][book-amaz] was a recommendation from someone at work. It is basically a
collection of blog posts turned into a book. That does not make it bad, but that is more or less
what you are getting. Parts are a bit dated belonging to the first bubble, but there are quite a few
solid nuggets in here to make it a worthwhile read.

My kindle apparently ate my highlights otherwise I would put something more interesting here.
