Thank goodness for leap day as I managed to technically get in another book
in February. I forgot why I added [*The Bell Jar*][bell-amazon] to my wishlist,
but it was sitting there when I went to buy another set of books so I figured
why not give it a shot. I think I wanted to read something by Sylvia Plath
as I have heard her name floated about but never really got around to it before.
As this is her only novel, it was a natural choice.

*The Bell Jar* is essentially autobiographical which makes it that much more
interesting to me, but even if it wasn't the story itself is quite good. The
writing is clearly on that higher level where you can tell the author really
gets it. Her use of just the write metaphor at the right time made certain
emotions come through in a distinct way. At the same time, it still comes
across as a first novel, raw and unpolished to a certain degree. The sad thing
is that she succeeded in killing herself before writing another novel which
could have really allowed her to stretch her abilities.

I highly recommend this book, although I will say it may be a tough read
from an existential perspective. There are a lot of depressing scenes
and themes that make you mentally have to work to distance yourself a bit
lest you fall victim to the same bell jar that the title represents. That
could be just my opinion as my mind has a tendancy to run wild when presented
with pessimistic, depressing styles of writing. I'm not naturally pessimistic
or depressed, but it just gets my mind going down strange rabbit holes.
Moreover, I do not think you have to be depressive to have a reaction to
this book. It has a subtle way of pulling you in even if you try to distance
yourself from the main character.
