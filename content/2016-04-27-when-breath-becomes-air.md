I heard about [*When Breath Becomes Air*][breath-amazon] coming
out probably because of the New York Times
article that the author wrote, but I am not entirely sure. I do not think
I read that article, only a snippet about the book. Basically, guy is a
doctor, finds out he has cancer, decides to write book while he is dying,
now he is dead, here is the book.

I was not sure what this book was going to be about going into it
and now I can say it was mostly a reflection on life, death, their
interplay, and meaning in general. There was a feeling similar to
*Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintainence* at times which I found
to be quite interesting. One thing he said which really struck me was

> direct experience of life-and-death questions was essential to
> generating substantial moral opinions about them

In other words, if you sit in academia and think about moral philosophy,
you are not really authoritative on the subject because you are living
too far removed from death. You lack moral action by restricting yourself
to the realm of words. Only from the edge can you really start to understand
morality. For the author, this was why he went to medical school and became
a surgeon, he believed that he was better able to understand meaning in life
by being on the frontline of life-and-death decisions.

My main problem with this book, common among surgeons, is their overwhelming
sense of self importance. He literally says that it was his job to choose
who gets to live and die and that responsiblity was important to him. Now
that is genuinely factual. A trama surgeon can make decisons during operations
or not to operate at all that lead to certain outcomes based on what they think
is best for someone. Sometimes the doctor thinks that death is preferable to
a diminished life or a vegetative state. But, he comes across as if he is
somehow more important because he decided to go to a trade school that results
in that type of day to day. Just like I do not think all soldiers, policemen,
fire fighters, are heros, not all surgeons instruments of divine intervention.
You go through life making decisions, one of those is how you spend your time
and how you choose to support yourself. One can choose to become a doctor just
as one can choose to be a carpenter. As a doctor you choose to help people in
a certain way, if that is for you then great, but you should not think of
yourself as morally superior because you decided on that career.

Nonetheless, the book itself is quite well written and offers a fair amount
of insight into the mind of the terminally ill. It is strange that people
tend to only think about life only when concerned with their ultimate demise,
as the author points out

> The fact of death is unsettling. Yet there is no other way to live.

You here people trying to get the most out of life only when they realize
they do not have much time left. Notions such as "bucket lists" become the
way that people try to internalize the fact that they are going to die,
will not have enough time to do everything they want, but do not really want
to fully grasp that concept. If they just make a list then they can try to
do some of those things and not really contemplate death. But if you really
face death, you will realize that all those things you think are part of
everyday life that are important maybe are not so.

> Most ambitions are either achieved or abandoned, either way, they belong to the past.

You have ideas of what your life to be, you work towards these goals delaying
gratification you think will come when you finally achieve your ambition. But then
you get there and realize you did not really enjoy the journey, you do not know
what to do next other than make a new goal and try to get their. That next one
will make you happy. Then you realize you actually are going to die, even though
subconsciously you hoped you would somehow be spared or that it was so far away
that it did not matter. You start to realize that if you keep going on this way,
you will constantly be living in the past and future until one day your present
no longer exists because you are dead. You struggle against that by blinding
yourself to the possibility. Most people cannot comprehend this nothingness
that awaits us all until it is too late. They try to ignore death by pawning off
moral and philosophical questions either to religion or ignorance.

Some people choose life. They choose life by accepting death. Face death not
as an enemy but as a guide on the journey you have. What makes life worth living?
Why do you not kill yourself and get it over with? Can you honestly look yourself
in the mirror and have a good answer for that? A lot of people think they can,
only because they lie to themselves so much they cannot tell the difference.
This book explores a lot of these themes and will help give you some perspective
on the human condition.
