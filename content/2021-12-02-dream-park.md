I listen to the A16Z podcasts and one of them is One on One with A and Z which is pretty good. I
think it is just recording a Clubhouse show, but I have only listened to it via the podcast feed. At
some point, they did some book recommendations and I wrote down a few that sounded interesting. One
of them was [*Dream Park*][book-amaz] which I just got around to reading.

This is a really fascinating book given the context that it was written in 1981. All sci-fi gets
some things really wrong, but focusing on the human elements that define some secular trends that
are playing out now make this seem quite prescient. That said, it also read like a lot of sci-fi
from that era with way too much unnecessary sexualization and objectification. Arguably that is what
the readers wanted at that time or at least that is what the publishers seemed to think they wanted.
It is not unique to this book, but it is still jarring to read.

The park in *Dream Park* is basically a hi-tech amusment park but the central draw is a type of
augmented reality game. The way it was executed is really AR instead of the VR style of *Ready
Player One* or *Snow Crash*. This makes it a nice counterpoint to those works and the increasing
discussion of the metaverse. Maybe AR is how games are really going to go. More likely some
combination of both depending on your preference.

The book is a murder mystery set within an interesting future. I recommend it especially if you are
into adventure style sci-fi.
