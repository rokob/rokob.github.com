Amazon created a TV series semi-based on this book and it was
available as part of the Unlimited Kindle reading program on
Amazon, so I decided to check it out. [*The Man in the High Castle*][man-amazon]
is a mindfuck. Seriously, I might have to read it again or just
think about it for a while before I really understand what the
hell happened. Nonetheless, it was pretty good.

Yet another Philip K. Dick novel where I have the distinct feeling
that I do not want to read any more of his books any time soon,
and yet I probably will keep reading more of them. They are not
masterpieces but they really get under your skin. *The Man in the High Castle*
on the surface is about an alternate universe where the Germans
and Japanese won the war and have therefore divided up the world.
The book has several characters that are existing in this world and going
about their alternate universe lives. In this alternate universe
there is a book about an alternate universe where the Allies won
the war. So you are a reading a book in the universe where the Allies won
the war about a universe where
the Axis won the war which contains a book about a universe where the
Allies won the war. And yet it is more complicated that even that
explanation. I do not like complicated for the sake of complication;
complex due to natural complexity is fine, I like that. I think
this book is more on the complex side of things, but that certainly
does not make it any easier to comprehend and follow.

If you like PKD then you will probably love this book, in fact
you have probably already read it. Also, if you
want to put some time into reading something thinking you have
it all figured out until the last 20 pages when you get your world
turned upside down and left hanging, then you will like this
book. On the other hand, if you want something straight forward
or linear to comprehend, then steer clear of this. In fact,
you probabyl should stay away from PKD all together, because 
even if you think you understand what is going on, there is
probably some underlying truth that you have yet to grasp.
