[*2666: A Novel*][book-amaz] is insane. I think it was quite good but it took me forever to read and
it was one of the most unique things I have ever read. It was all over the place at times and one
large part felt like it was complete batshit at times as it kept going on. The descriptions of
killings started to feel fake in their quantity but alas I know they are not. Even though this is
fiction that part is based at least partially on reality.

I highly recommend this, but make sure you are ready to commit to a long and complicated novel.
