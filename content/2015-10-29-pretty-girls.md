Since I am back on the reading train, I went all in and
plowed through [*Pretty Girls*][pretty-amazon], which
I decided to check out after an Amazon recommendation.
Amazon is pretty good at guessing what I enjoy, but
that should not be hard considering this is yet another
book about women in relationships with psychopaths who
are committing violent crimes.

I would not necessarily
jump out and say I really enjoy that theme per se, however
Amazon keeps recommending more of them, they keep showing up
on top book lists, and they are really page turners that
keep me engaged throughout.

I keep mentioning to someone that I read yet another book
about women getting murdered and they keep saying that I am
a weirdo for reading these books. However, I am really starting
to think that the general reading population is actually
just going down this darker path recently. *Gone Girl* is
probably the most well known of the books of this ilk, but
there are many more just like it, both that I have read and
that I have not. These are best sellers with a similar theme
of women being in bad relationships and young girls being murdered.
The main characters are women and the authors are women. I have
a feeling that the majority of the readers are also women as
it may be easier for them to identify with the characters
especially as topics of mother/daughter and sister/sister relationships
are often times central to the plot.

I would not be surprised if this book gets turned in to a movie,
although there is a lot of internal dialogue that would need to
be dealt with. I found it to be a very good book, a bit repeatative
at times, but overall definitely worth reading.
