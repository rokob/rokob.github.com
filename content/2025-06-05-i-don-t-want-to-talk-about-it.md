I heard about [*I Don't Want to Talk About It*][book-amaz] from *The Drive* podcast. I had a lot of
feelings reading it mostly because there was a lot of myself being described in the book in ways
that I never really understood were so common.

I have more to say about it, but it was a very good read and I think has a lot to say to all
different kinds of people.
