I heard about [*Fever House*][book-amaz] from a NYT Book Review podcast episode about favorite
horror books from a couple famous horror authors. Joe Hill recommended this and I thought it was
amazing.

The book is zany in a lot of ways and relies on just going with the flow and believing what is
happening. But with belief suspended, it is an incredible page turning thriller. I could barely put
it down.
