Another weird book that made it onto my list, but this one
turned out to just be weird in a bad way.
[*The Strange Library*][library-amazon] is a very short book
that makes no sense. It was a book of the month on Amazon
a few months ago, but I don't know why. I do not have
much to say about this book so I am not going to waste
my words writing about it. I do not recommend it to anyone.
I thought it was a waste of my time. Maybe for a kid it would
have been okay or maybe it was just way over my head, doubtful.
