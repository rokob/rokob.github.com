I have seen [*The Power of the Dog*][dog-amazon] on Amazon for quite
some time now; the cover kept drawing my eye and the description
was enough to have me put it on my wish list more than once
forgetting that it was already there. I finally got around
to reading it, and man was it good.

Not quite historical fiction, there is enough interplay with
reality that really serves to drive this book forward. One would
have thought this book to be pure insanity back in the early 80s, I mean
would the US government ever really help foreign cocaine smugglers move
drugs and weapons between Colombia, Mexico, and the US? Pure nutjob, conspiracy
theory crap. Except this is essentially the cynical view of what the CIA
really did. Maybe it is not just the cynical view, maybe it is just the
abbreviated view. In any event, this book is solidly written with
wonderful lines, great characters which are developed thorougly, and has a delightful
interplay between different story lines, different locations, and different
points in time.

I really like this style of writing. I am not sure if it even has a particular
name. Don Winslow weaves some great lines throughout this book, such as

> He half-expects to see blood in the bed -- his dreams are incarnadine;
> blood flows through them like a river, connecting one nightmare to another.

He also has an extensive vocabulary. The more I read, the more I am fascinated
by the existence of words that describe a situation or feeling or color
perfectly, where any other synonym would be lacking in specificity and
depth. For instance, `menagerie` is a word I did not know existed before
this book. The dictionary defines it as "a collection of wild animals kept in captivity for exhibition."
An alternative defintion is "a strange or diverse collection of people or things."
The former definition fits exactly into a couple scenes in the book,
and I was thinking if I was writing this how would I have described
a bunch of wild animals in kept in someones backyard in cages
for the purpose of showing them off? At the same time, the latter definition
also fits into describing the scene in a meta sense which gives even
more power to that single word. This is where I personally feel that
people involved in comparative literature and literary criticism can
go off the reservation by calling this usage brillant assuming the author
had both the surface intention as well as a deeper meta meaning intended
by the use of this one word. Maybe he did.

But, in another situation, 
he used the exact same analogy, comparing oil rig pilot lights to
some kind of street light in hell or something, within twenty or thirty pages
of one another. It felt like he wrote these two parts indepedently,
came up with this same analogy twice, and forgot that he had already
used it. Then he merged those two parts together, and I was left
feeling like it was an amateur move. The first time I saw the analogy,
as he actually wrote it, I felt it was awesome. Then when I come across
it again, I felt like it was really cheap and lessened the prior use.

Nevertheless, overally this book was exactly in my preferred style.
The writing was descriptive and had a certain literary depth. The
characters were relatable enough, but developed to the point of understanding
their motivations even where they were not relatable. The entire plot
was not too outrageous given the actualy reality of the drug wars
of the 1970s through 1990s. I highly recommend this, and I plan to
read his other book relatively soon as well.
