[*Deep Work*][book-amaz] has been sitting on my shelf for over a year. I had some time being sick to
do some reading so I decided to pull it off the shelf and read it.

I knew the basic premise of the book and it did not disappoint. More or less I understand and agree
with the concept. Some of the style of this type of book always rubs me the wrong way. Telling me
about some rich guy doing something as an example of why it is a good idea doesn't always sit well
with me as an argument. But nonetheless there were other sources of reasoning which confirmed my
preexisting biases towards the importance of doing work that is effortful and deep. I have mostly
disconnected myself from the normal distractions that other people fight with so I have less to
implement after reading this. However, I still am not doing as much deep work as I would like and
reading this helped me realize that and motivated me to put more effort into creating opportunities
for this type of work in my day to day life.
