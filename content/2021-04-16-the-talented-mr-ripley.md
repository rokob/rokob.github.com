I am really glad I decided to read [*The Talented Mr. Ripley*][book-amaz]. I was thinking that I had
seen the movie but after reading it I don't think I did. I think I saw parts of the beginning and
never really made it through. I have seen this book around and knew about the movie, but I never
expected it to be so good. I read a bit about Patricia Highsmith afterwards and I am now excited to
read some more things that she wrote. I won't say anymore as this is just a really good book and I
am so happy I read it without knowing how all the twists and turns play out.
