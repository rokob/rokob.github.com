This is the last of Gillian Flynn's books that I needed to read.
I read them nonchronologically, reading *Gone Girl* first, then
*Sharp Objects*, and finally [*Dark Places*][dark-amazon]. I have
decided after finishing this book that Gillian Flynn is one of my
favorite authors. All of her previous books had me on the edge of my
seat, and this was no different. I highly recommend this to anyone,
especially if you were a fan of Gone Girl.

Most people might feel that the subject matter is messed up, and the
attitude of the characters is very dark. Personally, I just think it is
more real than most books usually are. Obviously the subject matter
is morbid, but once you accept what occured, and who the characters are
relative to the events that took place, most of the book actually feels
pretty natural. I can't say that I had very interesting thoughts while
reading the book. I was just thoroughly entertained, as can be clearly seen
by the fact that I breezed through the 500+ pages in a couple days. I have
been trying to pace books out a bit more, but I was too interested
to find out what happened that I could not put the book down. Now I just
need her to write more books.
