I picked [*The Last Girl*][last-amazon] as my choice for the free book of
the month from Amazon, at least that is how I think I got this for free.
It was an okay book, the story was interesting, somewhat reminded me
of *Children of Men* just based on the premise of the world breaking down
if there was a problem with birthrates. This book centers around the concept
of the birthrate of girls dropping to zero rather than all births, but
that would be a byproduct eventually.

The character development of this book is what really turned me off. I had
trouble at times remembering who certain characters were or why I should
even care about them. There were groups of people introduced at the same
time with a few sentences of explanation that made them seem like
superfluous additions.

Apparently this is the first book in a series, but I do not plan on
reading any of the others. If you are really bored and like young, female
protagonists then maybe you should pick this up, otherwise move along.
