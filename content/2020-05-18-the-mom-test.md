I heard about [*The Mom Test*][book-amaz] several times on different startup and tech podcasts. I
decided to pick it up even though I'm not planning on starting a company at the moment. It is a
great "business" book because it does not try to fill out 200 pages when closer to 100 is all that
was needed. It is short and to the point and quite insightful.
