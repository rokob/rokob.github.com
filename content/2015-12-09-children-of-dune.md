Wow, *Dune* was long, a bit complex, and good; *Dune Messiah* was
similarly good, with a bit more complexity; [*Children of Dune*][child-amazon]
took the complexity up a notch and really rounded out the trilogy
quite well. I now feel that you have to read all three to really
appreciate the first novel.

I wonder if people who write multiple part series think upfront that
they are going to write a triology, or in the Harry Potter case a colleciton
of seven books. It is not necessary to plan this ahead of time. If one does then
it makes it easier to foreshadow across multiple novels. On the other hand,
I imagine writing a single, self-contained novel is not only eaier, but also
allows you some freedom to take the stor wherever it feels write to take it.
The difficulty must be in the ending. There is the question of whether to
ensure all threads are tied up at the end, or if it is okay to just let things
remain open ended as long as there is a satisfying ending. That is easier
said than done, but I think each Dune book that I've read so far has ended
in a way that allows the book to stand on it's own.

The one issue I had with this book is that I think I might have to read it
again at some point because there was so much that was left unexplained
and meant to be understood just by context. I personally love this style
of story telling and have a bit of a disdain for plot devices that are
there just to explain terminology or concepts in an imaginary universe.
But the flip side to that coin is the necessity to make conceptual leaps
and use a lot of memory to make connections and clarifications to previous
concepts as you get more information later in the story.

I highly recommend this book, however you absolute cannot read it by itself,
you must read the first two books before this one. In reality, I think
they are really just one long book that happens to be broken into three parts.
