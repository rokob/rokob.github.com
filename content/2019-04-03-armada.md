I enjoyed *Ready Player One* so much that I knew I was going to read [*Armada*][book-amaz]
eventually. A great idea, executed okay, resulting in a good book that could have been better. I
assumed this would end up as a movie, but after the *Ready Player One* fiasco who knows.

The government and scientists have been preparing us for the reality of aliens invading through
movies and video games. Aliens finally decide to show up and attack and video game players have to
use those skills to save the planet. I love the idea. The way the book played out was great until
the last quarter or so when things were rushed and not believable. Given so much suspension of
disbelief already that is saying a lot. However, it is the human elements that are not believable
rather than the science. I would have been willing to go through many more pages to get a better
ending, but I am not sure exactly how it could have been pulled off anyway.

This is definitely a fun read and will be enjoyable especially for those in the generation that
*Ready Player One* spoke to.
