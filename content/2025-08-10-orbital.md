 I picked [*Orbital*][book-amaz] to read as it is a winner of the Booker prize which has
 consistently been a great source of books to read. It was good, but not great. Overly literary,
 often times it felt like some sentences were written and then the rest was written around that
 because they sounded really neat.

 There was not much story here. Interestingly, there were moments of deep emotion evoked by the
 language, but that is about all I can say. It really is one of those books written for the writing
 rather than anything in particular that is trying to say.
