[*The Kingdom*][book-amaz] is both really annoying and amazing. It radically altered how I view
Chistrianity, The Bible, and the church. But the author is so self-obsessed that it was hard to get
past the nonsense to the real meat of the book.

I don't feel like writing a long post here about what I learned from this book. I've been working a
lot lately and haven't written all of these book posts close enough to when I finished these books.
I am hoping to get to reading more soon and have a plan on how to get these written at the same time
as I finish a book.

I highly recommend this book, but the first part is a dumpster fire. You have to make it past that
to get to the good part.
