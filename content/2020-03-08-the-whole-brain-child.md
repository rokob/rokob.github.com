[*The Whole-Brain Child*][book-amaz] is part of the current parenting zeitgeist mostly coming
out of Southern California psychology practices. Like many popular science books, it is repetitive
and could probably get away with half as many pages. But, I don't think publishers would take a
book that short because people don't take very short books seriously. So you fluff out to 200
pages. However, the overall message is good and it is an easy read.

I definitely recommend
this if you are doing the rounds of parenting books. I waited until now to read it because I knew
it would be less relevant for a very small child. Even still I probably got in a bit early as most
of the material is more suitable for older children.
