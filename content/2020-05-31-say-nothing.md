[*Say Nothing*][book-amaz] is a history of "The Troubles" which is a part of history that I only
vaguely understood before reading this book. This is a fantastic book with a wealth of information.
It tells the story of The Troubles through the lens of the disappearance (read: murder) of Jean
McConville. I learned a great deal and it made me interested in finding more books on the subject. I
presume my lack of knowledge of this period is a product of the selection of topics covered in the
standard history curriculum in America.
