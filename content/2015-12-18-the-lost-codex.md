After reading a few of the Scot Harvath books by Brad Thor,
Amazon recommended [*The Lost Codex*][codex-amazon] which is
part of the OPSIG series by Alan Jacobson. I barely read the
description before deciding to buy the book because it was
close enough to what I had read to pique my interest and I figured
what was the worst that could happen? Unbeknownst to me, this is actually
book number three in the series. I have never read a book in a series
out of order so I thought that was going to be pretty interesting
in and of itself.

*The Lost Codex* was okay, it was a fun, page-turning thriller
with a lot of action sequences and enough twists and turns to
keep me interested. My main problem with the book was the
inconsistent pacing and level of detail. At times there was an incredible
amount of detail about mundane activities, while some important
action scenes were over way to quick with a bit too much handwaving.
I felt like there was this big buildup with a lot of development
and then the climax was something like, we killed the guys and
ran away. Some of the action was more detailed and interesting,
but by the end I felt like I was filling in a lot of holes with
my imagination.

As I said, this is the third book in the series, and the first
one that I have read. I could tell where allusions were being
made to prior books, but it really was not that big of a deal.
I did not feel as if I was missing a bunch of inside jokes or
stories for having not read these books in order. I commend
the author for that. At the same time, I did not find too much
explanation of what went on in the other books which I also
liked, because I know if I had read them in order, too much
of that would have annoyed me.

Personally, I like the style of the Brad Thor books better.
I found this story to be pretty similar, although it was
centered around a different type of character which was
refreshing. I definitely recommend reading it if you
are in to action books and just want to have some fun
with a quick read. Do not expect a liteary masterpiece,
but that should be obvious as this book is clearly not
trying to bridge that gap. However, it definitely is not
the top of the heap in this genre. This is not *Rainbow Six*
quality by any stretch of the imagination.
