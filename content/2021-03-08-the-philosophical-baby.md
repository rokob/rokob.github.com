[*The Philosophical Baby*][book-amaz] is an interesting book from when viewed as a parenting book.
It presents a lot of modern scientific understanding of how we think the brain's of babies and
children work which helps explain certain otherwise befuddling scenarios. I think I found this book
from a reference in *How to Change Your Mind* because it was explaining how to openness of the brain
on psychedelics is very similar to the openness of the brain of young children.

I recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding why children think the way they do. It
helps drive home some things that we already knew like open ended play is good for children.
