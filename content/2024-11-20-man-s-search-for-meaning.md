Why I decided to buy and read [*Man's Search for Meaning*][book-amaz] at this moment I do not know.
However I am glad that I did. I have heard of it vaguely in passing but never really knew what it
was or what it was about.

This book is really two things put together. The first half is an account of time spent in the Nazi
concentration camps. The second half is an exposition of a philosophy to living that is born from
someone who lived before, during, and after that experience. Both parts are worth the read, although
the first hand account of the concentration camp is perhaps the more unique read.
