I really like Joe Hill and the latest novel of his for me was [*The Fireman*][book-amaz]. The idea
is great, the story was good, but I didn't really care about the main character as much as I
probably should have. Furthermore, he decided to really go for it and make something really long.
This could have used about 150 less pages.
