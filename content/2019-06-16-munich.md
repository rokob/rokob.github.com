From the author of [*An Officer and a Spy*](/blog/2015-02-08-an-officer-and-a-spy/) comes
[*Munich*][book-amaz] yet another wonderful piece of historical fiction. This is a fictional spy
thriller within the real setting of the Munich Conference in September 1938.

I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the writing. I know just enough about this period of history to
be dangerous, some of the finer details are not as fresh in my mind. Nonetheless, you do not have to
have that much context on the time to enjoy this book. The reality of the time is interwoven with a
fictional account that could for all intents and purposes actually have taken place.

I am now wondering how many other books of his I should read considering how much I enjoyed both of
these first two that I have read.
