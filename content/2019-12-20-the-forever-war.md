I forget how I came across [*The Forever War*][book-amaz], but I read it rather quickly when I
did get around to it and it is pretty good. Similar to *Old Man's War* which I read right
beforehand, but that actually made this more exciting. I think this is the deeper, more thoughtful
book although they were both enjoyable.
