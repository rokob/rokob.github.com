In many\nways it is a book about living a Jewish life and how that applies to situations involving children.\nIn other ways it is just a pretty good parenting book that uses Talmudic thought to ground the\nreasoning behind certain ideas. Overall this was a very interesting book when you take from it what\nyou want even if you don't want to go too deep into Jewish theology.</p>\n<p>As a short read with good tips I would certainly recommend this. It brought up a lot of thoughts\nabout potential scenarios in the future and how I might react.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Blessing Of A Skinned Knee","date":"22 Mar 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","nonfiction","parenting"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":111},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-03-22-the-blessing-of-a-skinned-knee.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-03-22-the-blessing-of-a-skinned-knee/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
