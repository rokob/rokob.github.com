Quite funny, although somewhat hard to read with\nvocabulary that required me to look up a lot more words than usual. A lot of cringey moments, but I\ngenerally found the satire to be poignant. A lot of talk of this book call it disturbing, but as\nsomeone roughly in the same age demographic as most of the characters I found it to be mostly just\nhilarious.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Rejection","date":"17 Aug 2025","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","society"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":144},"fields":{"sha":"40c97b904de32cfdc4e7e553e1711012d17014db"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2025-08-17-rejection.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2025-08-17-rejection/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
