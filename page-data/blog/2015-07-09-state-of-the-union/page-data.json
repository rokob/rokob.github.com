I know so much of this book is not close\nto being realistic but whatever it was still a quick, enjoyable\nread. The one issue with this book compared to the first\none or two in the series is that it felt rushed. It was a bit\nshorter than the others and everything wrapped up in a very\nhurried way. I think I will still add at least one more of these\nto my list to see if the trend in quality continues down or\npicks back up.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"State of the Union","date":"09 Jul 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":155},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-07-09-state-of-the-union.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-07-09-state-of-the-union/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
