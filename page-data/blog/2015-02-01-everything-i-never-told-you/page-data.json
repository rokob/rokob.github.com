I have read 8 books so far this\nyear and 3 of them have their main plot centered around\nyoung girls dying. I had reasons to pick these all that\nwere independent from reading their descriptions, but\nI think I might start reading the descriptions before\nadding more books to my reading list going forward.\nNot that these were bad, I just need a change of pace,\nbecause they are starting to get depressing. The third\nsuch book I have just finished is called\n<a href=\"http://amzn.com/B00G3L7V0C\"><em>Everything I Never Told You</em></a>.</p>\n<p>This book was pretty good. Many different themes were\nexplored and were handled really well. These themes\ninclude: feeling different like an outsider either\ndue to race or other factors, feelings of obligation\nand subjugation to what others want you to be at the\nexpense of your own wants and needs, feelings of living\nan unfulfilled life where your dreams never come true\nbecause life gets in the way, how communication or\nthe lack thereof can be so paramount to how relationships\nevolve, likewise how sometimes things not said can be\nmore important than everything that is said, and of course\nthe lack of control and loss that people feel when they\nlose a family member.</p>\n<p>Personally, this book made me think a lot about not\nliving someone else's life and not letting inertia take\nyou to a place where you look back and feel disappointment\nand regret. The mother in this book really exemplified\nthe negative impact of overbearing parenting from both\nher mother's treatment of her as well as her treatment of\nher daughter. It is always crazy when someone tries so hard\nto be the opposite of what they despise and they turn\nout to be the same in different clothing. This is often\nmy opinion about extremist ideologies. Replacing one word for\nanother, for example, the state in place of god, and you trade communism\nfor religious zealotry, and they hate each other fiercely, yet\nthey are really just the same thing. You hate how your mother\ntried to force you into just marrying a Harvard man and\nbeing a good homemaker, so you force your daughter into\nbeing a doctor like you wanted but failed to do because\nyou had your daughter instead. The wheels keep turning around\nthe same way even if the tune is different.</p>\n<p>I would not recommend reading this book immediately\nafter reading [<em>See How Small</em>] like I did, but in general\nI would recommend this book. It is mostly depressing, but\nI feel it has an honesty and realism that shine through\nto make it hard to put down.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Everything I Never Told You","date":"01 Feb 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","relationships","good","fiction"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":450},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-02-01-everything-i-never-told-you.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-02-01-everything-i-never-told-you/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
