This was a really fun read that had me\nexcited about getting to the end the entire time. I am generally\nimpatient when I read in the sense that I want to keep reading\na book that interests me until it is over at the expense of doing\nanything else. This book was no different.</p>\n<p><em>The Lions of Lucern</em> was not what I would call amazing by any\nmeans as it did have some flaws. The plot was a little bit\ncontrived and predictable at times, and the personality of the\nmain character was sometimes ridiculous to the point of making me\nsay \"you've got to be kidding me\" out loud. Nevertheless, the overall\nfeeling of the book was enjoyable and engaging enough to push past\nwhatever flaws that do exist.</p>\n<p>I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun thriller\nthat does not take things too seriously. By that I mean this is\ndefinitely in the spirit of Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum so this\nis not what you would one day call classic literature. I am looking\nforward to reading some of the other books in the Scot Harvath\nseries at some point in the future.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Lions of Lucerne","date":"24 Feb 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","military","good","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":236},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-02-24-the-lions-of-lucerne.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-02-24-the-lions-of-lucerne/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
