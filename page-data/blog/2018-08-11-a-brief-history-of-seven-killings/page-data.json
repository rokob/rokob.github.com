Each chapter is told from a different point of view, and these points of view vary wildly.\nA large portion of the book is in Patois which made the reading a struggle at times.</p>\n<p>The attempt on Bob Marley's life happened as did quite a bit of the background action in this book,\nbut the narrative itself is still fiction. I suppose that puts this in the historical fiction genre.\nThe book was good, but it was a slog. I was only partially invested in many of the characters\nbecause even though the development is good, they were not all treated equally.</p>\n<p>I'd recommend this if you are in to Jamaica and are willing to put in the time and effort. I have\nstarted reading these Man Booker Prize winners and they are mostly of this weird variety.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Brief History of Seven Killings","date":"11 Aug 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","death","drugs","fiction","good"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":166},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-08-11-a-brief-history-of-seven-killings.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-08-11-a-brief-history-of-seven-killings/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
