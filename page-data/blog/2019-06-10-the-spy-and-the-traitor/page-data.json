I am happy to have watched <em>The Americans</em> before reading it because there\nwas quite a lot of crossover.</p>\n<p>The story of Oleg Gordievsky is a fascinating one that I did not really know in any great detail. I\ndid know a bit more about Aldrich Ames, but this story was less about him per se than how he fit\ninto Oleg's story.</p>\n<p>True stories are often more unbelievable than fiction and some parts of this story fit that\ndescription. I found the whole thing to be exciting even though I had an inkling of how it was going\nto turn out. If you do not know the story then I highly recommened reading this book before doing\nany more digging.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Spy and the Traitor","date":"10 Jun 2019","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","history","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":147},"fields":{"sha":"dcfc573dc30a91819637467f0d5fb87c566c482d"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2019-06-10-the-spy-and-the-traitor.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2019-06-10-the-spy-and-the-traitor/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
