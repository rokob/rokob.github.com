The dark\ncomedy genre really fits my personality for some reason, and <em>NOS4A2</em> fits right into that. One\nmight say reasonably that this book is actually horror, but a little horror with a bit of comedy\nusually is more of a comedy to me.</p>\n<p>I had quite a few thoughts about this book, but I can't really remember them as I am writing this\nnow. I will come back to this when I have some time to put better thoughts down. Nonetheless, I\nreally liked this book.
