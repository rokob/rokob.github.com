I barely read the\ndescription before deciding to buy the book because it was\nclose enough to what I had read to pique my interest and I figured\nwhat was the worst that could happen? Unbeknownst to me, this is actually\nbook number three in the series. I have never read a book in a series\nout of order so I thought that was going to be pretty interesting\nin and of itself.</p>\n<p><em>The Lost Codex</em> was okay, it was a fun, page-turning thriller\nwith a lot of action sequences and enough twists and turns to\nkeep me interested. My main problem with the book was the\ninconsistent pacing and level of detail. At times there was an incredible\namount of detail about mundane activities, while some important\naction scenes were over way to quick with a bit too much handwaving.\nI felt like there was this big buildup with a lot of development\nand then the climax was something like, we killed the guys and\nran away. Some of the action was more detailed and interesting,\nbut by the end I felt like I was filling in a lot of holes with\nmy imagination.</p>\n<p>As I said, this is the third book in the series, and the first\none that I have read. I could tell where allusions were being\nmade to prior books, but it really was not that big of a deal.\nI did not feel as if I was missing a bunch of inside jokes or\nstories for having not read these books in order. I commend\nthe author for that. At the same time, I did not find too much\nexplanation of what went on in the other books which I also\nliked, because I know if I had read them in order, too much\nof that would have annoyed me.</p>\n<p>Personally, I like the style of the Brad Thor books better.\nI found this story to be pretty similar, although it was\ncentered around a different type of character which was\nrefreshing. I definitely recommend reading it if you\nare in to action books and just want to have some fun\nwith a quick read. Do not expect a liteary masterpiece,\nbut that should be obvious as this book is clearly not\ntrying to bridge that gap. However, it definitely is not\nthe top of the heap in this genre. This is not <em>Rainbow Six</em>\nquality by any stretch of the imagination.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Lost Codex","date":"18 Dec 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","history","okay","thriller"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":435},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-12-18-the-lost-codex.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-12-18-the-lost-codex/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
