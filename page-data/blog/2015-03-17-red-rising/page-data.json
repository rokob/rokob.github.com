It is kind of like in Harry Potter how you can\nexplain most things away with selective use of certain types of magic or\nrules about magic that you can make up as you go along.</p>\n<p>This was a different take on the kids killing kids genre and overall class\nwarfare because it is set in space a long time after certain wars have taken\nplace which makes society a much different place. As this is the first book\nin a trilogy which I am not sure I will finish, I understood that much of what\nI wanted explained is probably being saved for future books. It was a page\nturner for me, as I am easy to get catch on a cliffhanger.</p>\n<p>The idea of enslaving part of the human race to support so-called higher classes\nis clearly not new, but the way it was executed was particularly interesting. Certain\ngroups of people are enslaved but do not realize they are slaves because they\nthink they are pioneers working for a future generation of colonizers which will\ncome after them. Keeping a totalitarian hold on a group of people on the scale of\nan entire planet is tough. This book had some interesting solutions to those problems.\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quick, fun read. I may\nadd the other two books in the series to the end of my list, we shall see.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Red Rising","date":"17 Mar 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","okay","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":322},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-03-17-red-rising.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-03-17-red-rising/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
