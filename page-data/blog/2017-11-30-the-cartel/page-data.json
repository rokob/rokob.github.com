{"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-blog-post-js","path":"/blog/2017-11-30-the-cartel/","result":{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PP3DNCE\"><em>The Cartel</em></a> is the sequel to Don Winslow's <em>The Power of the Dog</em> which blew me\naway when I read it in January of last year. I immediately put this book on my reading list, but did\nnot manage to get around to it until now. I have been reading a lot less this year than in the past\ntwo for a variety of reasons. Luckily my list persists across my own negligence and rewards me with\nbooks like <em>The Cartel</em>.</p>\n<p>As a sequel, this book does the job of continuing the narrative of DEA agent Art Keller against\nnarco Adan Barrera. It does justice to the first in both breadth and intellectual continuity. The\ncharacters develop from the first in ways that are justified and within what we know about them. All\nthat said, this book stands on its own. One could skip <em>The Power of the Dog</em> and just read this\nbook and still come away satisfied. There are a lot of references to the past, but they are woven\nthroughout in a way that gives enough background to allow you to just read this one. Moreover, the\namount of character development in this book makes you feel like you are meeting Art and Adan all\nover again, because in a sense as they have grown you are meeting them again.</p>\n<p>Most of America is only vaguely aware of the scale of violence perpetrated so close to their homes\nover the past twenty years. While this is technically a work of fiction, a great deal of the\nbloodshed is based on fact. Upper middle class America thinks of this type of attrocity as only\noccuring in downtrodden African and Middle Eastern countries. To accept that thousands of people\nwere brutally tortured and murdered just across the border is something that America does not seem\nready to do.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend both of this books. Don Winslow has a writing style that I enjoy so much that I\nhave begun to incorporate it into my own writing. I'm looking forward to putting some more of his\nbooks on my reading list.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Cartel","date":"30 Nov 2017","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","fiction","great","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":352},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2017-11-30-the-cartel.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017-11-30-the-cartel/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
