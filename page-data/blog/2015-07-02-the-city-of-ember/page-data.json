This book was much shorter and less well\ndeveloped. It was a very quick and easy read,\nand the foreshadowing was way too obvious. It was\npretty clear what was going to happen all throughout.</p>\n<p>I would still recommend this book if you want to have\nan easy read, or you have some other need to get in to\nyet another distopian trilogy. I may read the rest of\nthe books in the series just to see where it goes,\nbut I can't say they are very high on my list.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The City of Ember","date":"02 Jul 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","okay"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":115},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-07-02-the-city-of-ember.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-07-02-the-city-of-ember/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
