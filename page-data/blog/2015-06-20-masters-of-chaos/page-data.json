This sounded interesting to me so I put it near the top of my list.</p>\n<p><em>Masters of Chaos</em> presents a brief overview of the history of\nthe Army Special Forces, followed by a more in depth look at\nthe major conflicts they have been involved in since roughly\nthe late 1980s and continuing through the early 2000s in\nIraq. The breakdown of how SF was used in each of these conflicts\ngives one a decent idea of how SF operates. It is clear where\ntheir strengths and weaknesses guide many of the actions that\nthey participate in. Clearly this work only covers a subset\nof the different teams and groups during different conflicts,\nas well os only really covering actions taken during known,\novert wars and missions. But the general picture of fighting\nby, with, and through foreign allies is overwhelmingly clear.</p>\n<p>I also found this book gave a different perspective on the\nconflicts themselves. There are definitely entire books dedicated\nto each of the conflicts the US has been a part of over the past 30\nyears, but this gives a unique perspective through the eyes of\nthe SF soldiers on the ground. I found it to be an easy read, although\nit was a bit disjointed at times seeming like a collection of stories\nrather than a wholly coherent narrative.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Masters of Chaos","date":"20 Jun 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","history","military","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":253},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-06-20-masters-of-chaos.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-06-20-masters-of-chaos/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
