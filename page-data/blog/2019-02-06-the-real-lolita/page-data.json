It is one of the only audiobooks that I have ever made it all the way\nthrough and actually felt like I followed what was happening. I can still hear Jeremy Irons' voice\nin my head reading the book. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Real-Lolita-Kidnapping-Horner-Scandalized-ebook/dp/B076P91Z4D\"><em>The Real Lolita</em></a> is a non-fiction look at a real crime\nthat took place in 1948-1950 and how it influenced <em>Lolita</em>.</p>\n<p>The most interesting part of this book was how much Nabokov and his wife tried to evade any\nconnection between art and real life. They constantly denied that <em>Lolita</em> had any basis in\nsomething that might have actually happened. And yet this book makes a pretty compelling case that\nnot only is the real case similar in many ways to the fictional one, but also that Nabokov\ndefinitely knew about it and left clues throughout <em>Lolita</em> as to the connection.</p>\n<p>If you have not read <em>Lolita</em> this book might not be as interesting as there are some references\nwhich you will not get. But it is nonetheless a great piece of literary detective work that one\nwould find enjoyable even without knowing the underlying source.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Real Lolita","date":"06 Feb 2019","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","history","nonfiction","crime"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":191},"fields":{"sha":"e2fc56d5d6fe58fab00f9b54d19acba57f5d7d2d"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2019-02-06-the-real-lolita.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2019-02-06-the-real-lolita/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
