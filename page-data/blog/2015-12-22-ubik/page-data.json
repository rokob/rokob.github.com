Dick is widely regarded as one of the top tier\nscience fiction writers of all time. At the same time, he\nseems to have a bit of bimodal influence on people: either\nyou love him or you do not understand what the hype is all\nabout. I guess I should not have said that and then followed\nit up with the fact that I am somewhere inbetween these two\nextremes. I thought <em>Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep?</em>\nwas quite good, but I think <a href=\"http://amzn.com/0547572298\"><em>Ubik</em></a> is only\nokay. I wouldn't go out of my way to read this particular\nstory by PKD, but I also would not call it bad by any stretch\nof the imagination. <em>Ubik</em> was definitely unique, funny,\nthought-provoking, and exciting.</p>\n<p>Most science fiction writing that is considered good is\nconsidered as such because of the ideas not the writing\nper se. Sometimes I come across a book that is supposed\nto be classic in the genre, but I feel like that moniker\nwas given only because of the novelty rather than the prose.\nThe small sample of PKD that I have read so far leads me\nto believe that he his writing can be top notch along with\nthe novelty of his ideas, however it is not always so.\nI felt that Ubik had moments of quality writing, but\noverall it lacked a certain flow due to poor pacing and\nan odd style. I am pretty sure it was intentially confusing,\nthat was part of the story, but beyond that it was still\nnot that great of writing.</p>\n<p>I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan,\nbut I would caution you not to judge PKD solely by this\nwork. I have yet to read a lot of his stuff, but\nmy understanding is that this is not on the top\nof his totem pole. That being said, it is more of a short\nstory than a novel, so you would not be hard pressed\nto grind this out in a day or two.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ubik","date":"22 Dec 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","okay","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":341},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-12-22-ubik.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-12-22-ubik/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
