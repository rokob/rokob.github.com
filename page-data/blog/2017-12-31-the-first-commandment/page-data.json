These books are a bit of my guilty reading pleasure so there is not much to say about\nit.</p>\n<p>One problem that annoys me with these serial books is the tendency to rehash stories from previous\nbooks. I get why they do it because it allows someone to pick up any book in the series and not be\ncompletely lost. However, I wish someone would just write a book series assuming you had read all\nthe other ones and just not retell things I already know. Maybe my memory for what happened in the\nother books is better than other people, but it still annoys me.</p>\n<p>As with the others, if you are in to outlandish thrillers involving terrorists and whatnot, then\nthis is another good read.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The First Commandment","date":"31 Dec 2017","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":145},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2017-12-31-the-first-commandment.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017-12-31-the-first-commandment/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
