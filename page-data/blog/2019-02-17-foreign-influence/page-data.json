An\nindulgent page turner from the get go, this one falls in the middle of the pack among the books in\nthis series.</p>\n<p>I started to get the impression that the author realizes he blew too much of Scot's time in the\nfirst few books and is making up for it now. The first couple books spanned some time and major life\nchanges. At this point, to be able to make the series go on for a while, he is having to compress\nboth the time within the book and the time between books. This is not altogether bad, but this one\nreally ended pretty abruptly with some major happenings all crammed into the end.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't pick up the series with this book, but if you have been following along then this one\nwill not disappoint. The one aspect that is starting to grate on me is the incessant need to talk\nabout how \"America's enemies don't play by the rules, so why should we?\" I get the sentiment of the\ncharacter and who he is supposed to be, but even then it is starting to be a bit of a stretch.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Foreign Influence","date":"17 Feb 2019","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":207},"fields":{"sha":"0a2fbdfd2a57baa77abc76cfd7a75aa371caebcb"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2019-02-17-foreign-influence.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2019-02-17-foreign-influence/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
