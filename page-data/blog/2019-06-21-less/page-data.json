That says something about me more than this book.\nI certainly have never read something where the sexuality of the main character is\ndiscussed so frequently and drives the plot. Great character writing is such that no matter who you\nare, you feel like you understand the characters and therefore have a empathetic connection. This is\na great book in that vein.</p>\n<p>The ideas of growing older and the changing nature of who we are, who we love, and how\nthe world sees us is transcendent. The concept of the book is meta discussed within and as a reader\nyou are left to decide for yourself if you agree with the sentiment of the other's inside this\nworld. All this is wrapped in a comedy that is clever if not\nalways laugh out loud funny. The fictional writer-cum-protagonist has his work described as\nmagniloquent which describes this book very well (after I looked up what it meant). I understand why\nit won the Pulitzer Prize as the writing was some of the more enjoyable I have experienced in a\nwhile, not withstanding the amount of words I had to look up to make it through.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend this book. It is short but not a short read as the chapters are awfully long\nwhich are difficult for me to fight through.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Less","date":"21 Jun 2019","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":245},"fields":{"sha":"85412b8976f2e6f622d04756bd3fcb007372339b"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2019-06-21-less.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2019-06-21-less/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
