It has been a while since I read the third book so quite a bit of the\nnames and events caused some head scratching as to exactly who was who.</p>\n<p>Normally in series books, the author will spent way too much time doing a recap of what happened in\nthe previous book(s). I usually hate this because either my memory is good or I read the books so\nclose together that I haven't had time to forget yet. In this book I felt he did not do much of a\nrecap at all, so I was left trying to remember exactly who knew who from where. It does not help\nthat most of the names are ridiculous compound ancient greek/roman mashups.</p>\n<p>Overall this book was good, not as good as some of the others, but still a fun read. I am calling it\njust okay because it was laborious at times. He could have trimmed at least 100 pages and not lost\nanything of substance. Moreover, it is definitely a setup for the next book which was disappointing\nat the end.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Iron Gold","date":"21 Jan 2019","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","okay","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":204},"fields":{"sha":"e75a86d47abddf5010cb390136682488daa5beb1"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2019-01-21-iron-gold.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2019-01-21-iron-gold/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
