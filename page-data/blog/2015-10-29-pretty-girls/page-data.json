However, I am really starting\nto think that the general reading population is actually\njust going down this darker path recently. <em>Gone Girl</em> is\nprobably the most well known of the books of this ilk, but\nthere are many more just like it, both that I have read and\nthat I have not. These are best sellers with a similar theme\nof women being in bad relationships and young girls being murdered.\nThe main characters are women and the authors are women. I have\na feeling that the majority of the readers are also women as\nit may be easier for them to identify with the characters\nespecially as topics of mother/daughter and sister/sister relationships\nare often times central to the plot.</p>\n<p>I would not be surprised if this book gets turned in to a movie,\nalthough there is a lot of internal dialogue that would need to\nbe dealt with. I found it to be a very good book, a bit repeatative\nat times, but overall definitely worth reading.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pretty Girls","date":"29 Oct 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","fiction","good","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":300},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-10-29-pretty-girls.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-10-29-pretty-girls/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
