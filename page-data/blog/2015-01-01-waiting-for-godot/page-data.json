I had never heard of it before it was suggested to me,\nand as I sat down to read it, I knew nothing about it. It was one of the worst\nbooks I've ever read.</p>\n<p>There seems to be a stereotypical depiction of the post-modern novel/play\namong those who are anti-academic that is similar to the portrayal of modern\nart as paintings of penises and eyeballs or performance pieces of a girl\nhaving her period on the floor of a glass box. While this is certainly\ntrue of a good portion of modern art, it misses the point. The point of\nminimalist art is to evoke an emotional response in the reader/viewer. I believe\nthis is true of all art, but it is often the only quality of minimalism\nbecause, well, there isn't anything else there. For instance, realist paintings\ncan evoke an emotional response, but they can also portray something real\nas it is or as it ought to be. It is in this sense that modern/minimal art\nis more subjective than other styles and really does require the clich√© of\nbeauty being in the eye of the beholder.</p>\n<p>Unlike most visual art, literature also allows for people to read between\nthe lines and interpret what the author was really trying to say. This leads\nto the world of comparative literature and the finding of meaning where none\nwas intended. Sometimes meaning really is there for the taking, other times\nsomething is just so much gibberish that you can see whatever you want if\nyou stare at the tea leaves long enough.</p>\n<p><em>Waiting for Godot</em> is definitely in the category of minimal post-modern\nliterature which has been over analyzed to the point of insanity.\nHence, one could argue on one hand that my dislike of the novel is merely\nmy opinion and that the emotional response that others experience is unique\nto them and therefore their opinion of the play as a masterpiece can be justified.\nOn the other hand, one could argue that I am simply not understanding the deeper,\nallegorical tone, and that if I took the time to interpret the play fully, then\nI would see it for the work of genius that it is. I disagree with both\nof these sentiments, although I think that they are merely begging the question.</p>\n<p>I would not recommend this play, it bored me, I found it's underlying theme\nto be depressing and untrue, and I found it to be an ineffective mechanism\nfor conveying it's message.</p>\n<p>I am trying to read more this year, so hopefully I will be writing more about\nbooks as I read them. I am not writing book reports or summaries, but\nmostly just my reactions to them, whether I liked them, whether I would\nrecommend them, and whatever thoughts they raise as I am reading them. This\nwas the first of the year, and it wasn't very good and it was very short\nso I didn't even really have much extra thought going on. Hopefully these\nbecome more interesting over time. More than anything, these posts\nare a way for me to document what I read.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Waiting For Godot","date":"01 Jan 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","play","bad","fiction"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":543},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-01-01-waiting-for-godot.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-01-01-waiting-for-godot/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
