I learned it was a collection of short stories that were turned into\nsomething more of a novel after being put into something of a chronological order.</p>\n<p>The book was good, not as great as I think people make it out to be. I had to remember the context\nof when it was written to appreciate it because otherwise some of the novelty is lost with time.
