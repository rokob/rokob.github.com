They are\nthe Army's tier 2 special forces operators analogous to the SEALs which\nrepresent the Navy's tier 2 special forces operators. I have read about\nwhat they do in theory but until reading\n<a href=\"http://amzn.com/0553807579\"><em>Lions of Kandahar</em></a>, I did not fully appreciate their\nday to day lives on deployment. The main distinguishing factor that\nsets Army special forces apart is how they train and fight with\nindigenous armies.</p>\n<p>Working with the armies native to a country seems like a good idea\nbecause they will be the ones left when the Americans pull out. This also\nprovides for an opportunity to help build a country up rather than just\ntear it apart. However, from reading this book, it sounds awful. It is\ncrazy to put your life in the hands of soldiers with training that is so\nfar inferior to ours. I could see trusting the other special forces guys\naround you because you have a shared set of training and experiences. But,\ntrusting the guys who may very well be spys for the enemy or simply run away\nat the first sign of trouble, does not sound like a great way to fight a\nwar to me.</p>\n<p>The book details a series of firefights that occured in the taking of\nthe city of Kandahar in southern Afghanistan in 2006. It was a very\ngood portrait into a crazy series of conflicts. I found it to be well\nwritten and pretty engaging. I would recommend it especially if you\nare interested in a some war stories. It made me realize that the Army\nspecial forces is probably not the right place for me. I would not\ncompletely rule it out, but based on how things operate in this book,\nI doubt it would interest me day to day.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Lions of Kandahar","date":"10 Mar 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","military","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":307},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-03-10-lions-of-kandahar.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-03-10-lions-of-kandahar/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
