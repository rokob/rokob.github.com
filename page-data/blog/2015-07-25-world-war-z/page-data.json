If I can read\na book and watch a movie, both with different titles,\nand only vaguely feel like they are connected by some\nsubject matter coincidence, then they should not be\nconsidered the alternative media representations.\nHad World War Z the movie had another name, I would\nnot have known about the book, but luckily watching the\nmovie did not spoil <a href=\"http://amzn.com/B000JMKQX0\"><em>World War Z</em></a> at\nall as they share only a name.</p>\n<p><em>World War Z</em> is one of the best books I've read in a\nwhile. Seriously, it is a very interesting analysis\nof humanity when faced with the threat of extinction\nat the hands of the undead. This book is a thinly veiled\npiece of political and social commentary. While you might\ndisagree with how realistic certain situations might be,\nor disagree with what is implied about humanity, the book\nnonetheless is quite interesting and enjoyable.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, World War Z the movie shares two things\nwith the book: the title and zombies. Almost nothing else\nsurvives. Part of the bit about Israel overlaps but that\nis basically it. I found the movie to be entertaining, but\nI am very glad I saw it before reading the book. This is because\nof <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>. One of my favorite books\nof all time, so when I found out there was a modern movie\nI was pretty excited; that is, until I saw it. The movie and books\nagain shared a title, the names of a few characters, and\na handful of slight similarities. But I found that movie to\njust be horrible because of the expectations set by the book.\n<em>World War Z</em> made into a movie true to the book could have\nbeen awesome, just like <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> could be\nan awesome (albeit likely 12 hours long) movie.</p>\n<p>I don't understand\nwhat goes through the minds of movie producers. Scratch that,\nI understand it, but I disagree with it. My understanding is\nthat they are trying to appeal to the broadest audience,\nspend the least amount of money, and make something passable\nenough that it sells a lot of tickets. Okay, as a for profit\nenterprise I guess that is reasonable. However, it robs\nus of great, entertaining works of art. There is an implicit\nassumption about the level of intelligence and attention span\nof the average moviegoer that goes into the decision to make\na more action oriented film version of a book. Even though\nthis is true, the fact remains troubling.</p>\n<p>My recommendation is to see the movie, and then read the book,\nor just read the book. I found the book to be thoroughly readable\nand entertaining, and yet still \"deep\" in some ways. If you\nreally concentrate on the reality of what a zombie plague could\ndo to the world, and then tie that back to an allegory about\nthe current state of the world, you are left with something\nmeaningful to think about.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"World War Z","date":"25 Jul 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","scifi","society"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":523},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-07-25-world-war-z.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-07-25-world-war-z/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
