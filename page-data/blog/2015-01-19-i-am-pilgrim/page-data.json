However, it takes\na good book to keep me wrapped up, to transport me to it's universe\nwhere I can start to imagine that reality as the true one.\n<a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00DPM90C4\"><em>I Am Pilgrim</em></a> is a prime example of just such\na book.</p>\n<p>This book is really quite good. Again, it isn't some deeply\nartistic book, with complicated allegories or an overwhelmingly\nemotional presence. No, it was just simply the type of book\nthat you can't put down. You just need to know what is going\nto happen around the next corner. One book I really enjoyed\nfrom my adolescence was <em>Rainbow Six</em>. What got me about that\none was how there were so many different story lines going on\nat once that seemed altogether unrelated. If you haven't read\nit, I am sorry to break the news to you here, but when all\nof those stories collide, I felt one of those moments of awe\nas if seeing someone perform a complicated athletic feat yet\nmake it look effortless. <em>I Am Pilgrim</em> wove a similar\nnarrative. I don't think it was quite as good in that there were\nless stories going on, but the overall effect was similar.</p>\n<p>This is a book about a spy chasing a bad guy to put it simply.\nBut, there was a lot more to this than just plain good versus\nplain evil. There was nuance to the good that made him seem\nless wholesome, as well as nuance to the evil that made you\nfeel compassion or at least an understanding of his motivations.\nThe reader is not forced to accept a clear, unquestionable\nmorality. Rather, the book seems to take the reader on the\njourney with the protagonist, leading you ultimately to one\nperspective on the events that take place, but nonetheless\ngiving you a sense of freedom.</p>\n<p>I would recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers\nand spy novels in general. Similar to Tom Clancy or\nthe Jason Bourne series, but much more modern and personally\na little more relatable.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I Am Pilgrim","date":"19 Jan 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","crime","great","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":373},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-01-19-i-am-pilgrim.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-01-19-i-am-pilgrim/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
