What put me over the top to finally\nadd this to my reading list was glancing at a few of the reviews for\n<em>The Nightingale</em> which said this book was better than that one in\nthe genre of World War II historical fiction. To that point I think I\nagree.</p>\n<p><em>All the Light We Cannot See</em> is supurbly written not just in terms\nof prose, but in terms of style by mixing narrators and time in\nan interesting and entirely clear way. I enjoy short chapters for whatever\nreason, and this book basically had large chapters broken up into tiny\nchapters which made the book easy to pick up at any time without having\nto worry about finding a decent stopping place. I read this a little\nslower than other books, which allowed me to really think about\nwhat was going on a bit more. I think this helped me to really appreciate\nthe plot unfolding moreso than if I tried to rush through it.</p>\n<p>All that being said, I do not really have a lot to say about the book\nbeyond that it was great. I did not really have too many deep philisophical\nthoughts while reading it, at least to the point that I remember them\nand want to comment on them here. I recommend reading the book, that is\nabout all I have to say about it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"All the Light We Cannot See","date":"28 Jan 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","history"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":261},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-01-28-all-the-light-we-cannot-see.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-01-28-all-the-light-we-cannot-see/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
