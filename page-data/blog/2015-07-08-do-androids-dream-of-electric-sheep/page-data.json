Dick is considered\none of the better authors of the past 50-60 years or so. I also knew\nthat it was the basis for the movie Blade Runner, which I saw a long, long\ntime ago and have been meaning to watch again. I figured I would read the\nbook before watching the movie again.</p>\n<p>There is good character development, an interesting and novel plot, and\nenough twists and turns to keep one interested. It is a good book in itself\nbut even more so within the sci fi genre. I think I will probably try\nto explore more of Philip K. Dick's books.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep","date":"08 Jul 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":162},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-07-08-do-androids-dream-of-electric-sheep.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-07-08-do-androids-dream-of-electric-sheep/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
