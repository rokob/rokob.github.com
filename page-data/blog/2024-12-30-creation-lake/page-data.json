I have read maybe five or six Booker Prize winners over the past\nseveral years and they nearly all have been amazing.</p>\n<p>I had no idea what this book was going to be about before reading it and I am kind of glad because I\nam not sure I would have wanted to read it. That said, it was quite entertaining and very well\nwritten. The book made it hard to put down as I wanted to know what was going to happen next, but I\nalso did not want it to end as it was both funny and emotional. It wasn't the best book I've read\nthis year, but it is something I highly recommend.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Creation Lake","date":"30 Dec 2024","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":137},"fields":{"sha":"3718ecaf10eeea0ac04bf2a1dc4583e1f3716057"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2024-12-30-creation-lake.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2024-12-30-creation-lake/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
