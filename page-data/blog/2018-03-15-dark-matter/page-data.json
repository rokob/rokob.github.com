A science fiction thriller driven by some hand wavy quantum mechanics.</p>\n<p>Is who we are really just the collections of choices we have made or is there something more to it\nthan that? That is the fundamental idea that I gleaned from this book. A guy is fighting to get his\nlife back which was stolen by himself, a different version of himself which created a way to jump\nbetween alternate universes.</p>\n<p>It was an okay book. A quick read, one that I wanted to know what was going to happen next enough to\ndrive me. However the overall writing style was not the best, and there were too many elements where\nI just was bored by the main character. I would not recommend this one unless you are really into\nthis specific genre of scifi.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dark Matter","date":"15 Mar 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","okay","scifi","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":178},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-03-15-dark-matter.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-03-15-dark-matter/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
