I am now at a\nstart-up called <a href=\"http://www.flexport.com\">Flexport</a>, which I doubt many people have heard\nof yet. We are working on fixing the inefficiencies in international trade\nwith the ultimate goal of making global trade frictionless. Clearly we\nhave more down to earth plans which we are starting with, but that is the\nvision that helped me make my decision to join. I was not going to write a\npost about why I left Facebook in much detail, but I think it is worthwhile\nto get some thoughts out there in the open.</p>\n<p>Let me start out by saying, that my time working on the iOS product infrastructure\nteam at Facebook was both challenging and rewarding. I think everyone who is\ninvolved with product infrastructure, both engineers and management, and across\nthe different technology stacks: web, iOS, and Android, are incredibly talented.\nI was thoroughly pleased with the fact that I got to work along side them.\nSo I just want to be clear that I didn't leave because I was pissed off at my\nteam or my manager, or anything petty like that. The reasons I left, in\nno particular order, are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Company Direction</li>\n<li>Boredom</li>\n<li>Learning Opportunities</li>\n<li>Quality vs Quantity</li>\n<li>Monetary Considerations</li>\n<li>Size</li>\n<li>The Analytics Org</li>\n<li>Product/Purpose</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I guess it would make sense to address each of these because they certainly can\nbe misinterpreted. I also want to be clear from the outset that I understand\nthat there are many facets to every seemingly obvious fact and so my opinion\nabout how something is/was might not match that of another person even though\nwe both thought we were looking at the same thing. I will justify what I am\nsaying to some extent, but in a lot of ways these are just my feelings about\nhow things were and I don't want to get into a long winded discussion of the\nminutiae.</p>\n<h3>Company Direction</h3>\n<p>Facebook is a product company first, the collection of products that define\nthe site/app begin with Newsfeed, continue with things like Photos and Chat,\nand then keep going through a long tail of things like Gifts and Groups. Because\nof the size of the user base, nearly every feature is used by millions of people,\nbut real usage is measured in the tens to hundreds of millions. Facebook is\nan engineering company second. The culture is very much driven by the engineering\norganization and the engineers within, but they are primarily focused on getting\niterations on the product out the door. Contrast this with a place like Google\nwhich is an engineering company first. The product is the result of engineering\neffort. They are focused on solving a challenging problem, and then presenting\nthat solution to the world wrapped in a product. I have never heard anyone disagree\nwith this sentiment at a high level, although you can certainly disagree if you\nare one of the guys working on the Linux kernel at Facebook. But at the end of\nthe day, Facebook is about the product.</p>\n<p>I have no qualms with that in principle,\nbut I have felt that Facebook has not actually meaningfully innovated on the\nproduct in a way that people actually use in a long time. You could point to\nTimeline, Graph Search, Home, Paper, but I would remind you that only one of those\nhas meaningful usage numbers and that is only because it was forced (Timeline).\nAs a user, Facebook hit a product peak for me near the advent of feed. A thousand\nsmall improvements and tweaks have made the site not look and feel like geocities\nlike it used to, but everything has felt incremental to me.</p>\n<p>Now, where is all of this going? Will Facebook innovate drastically, or will it\ncontinue to do things incrementally? I think the potential to innovate is there,\nbut I don't see it really taking off inside of Facebook. I think the people with\nthe most potential are going to strike out on their own and take a flier on their\nidea. Facebook is trying to capture this with the Creative Labs effort, but I didn't\nfeel that was working in a way that would ultimately prove successful. Combine this\nwith the seemingly random series of acquisitions and plans for free internet for\nthe whole world via drones, I just don't see the company going in a direction that\nI am interested in.</p>\n<h3>Boredom</h3>\n<p>I have a strange personality combined with quite a bit of Asperger's apparently.\nHowever, I know myself very well, even if what I am is odd. One thing I have learned\nthrough observation is how I go through cycles of extreme productivity and mild\nunproductivity. The cycles are both large, on the order of years, and small, on the\norder of days. During my less productive years I get into states of boredom where\nI start to question my entire past and future path through life. For instance,\nwhile studying for my qualifying exam after the first year of my PhD at Princeton,\nI pondered the idea of dropping out and enrolling in college again to get a degree\nin Physics so that I could go in to a Physics PhD program and study cosmology.\nI was just at a bit of a crossroads, and I think subconsciously I was a bit uneasy\nabout the exam I had coming up because I had heard some horror stories about\npeople being forced out if they failed. My confidence is typically irrationally\nhigh, but sometimes my subconscious is more rational. That combined with a bit of\nuncertainty about what the hell I was going to do even if I finished my PhD resulted\nin me getting into a bored state where I was not productive for a few weeks and\nwas looking at every possibility. I forced myself to suck it up and told myself that\nif I couldn't pass the exam then I wasn't actually smart, and if I passed then I could\nrevisit these thoughts. So naturally I studied and got through it, and by that time my\nboredom had blown over into a year of more productivity. I rode that productivity\nthrough the end of my PhD, but by the end it was starting to taper out and I was\ngetting back into some unproductive times.</p>\n<p>Caltech was very unproductive for me in terms of actual work output, but it was\nactually quite productive at understanding myself. That is the trade-off I usually\nencounter, I can either be internally productive or externally productive, but\nrarely both. Long story short, this last year at Facebook started out very productive,\nI had a bit of productivity that I rode out of data science and carried me for a while.\nHowever, the past few months I think I started to enter into a more bored and\ncontemplative phase. Based on my past I can get out either by punching myself or\nchanging what I am doing, or just waiting some time. I decided to consider the\npossibility of leaving and to think about some other factors to see if it made sense.\nIn the end I didn't leave just because I was bored, because clearly I could have\ngone to a different team or whatever, but the bored state of being that I find myself\nfrom time to time opened up the door for me to entertain the possibility.</p>\n<h3>Learning Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Okay all that talk about boredom has made me realize that I put too many bullet points\nfor me to actually want to write about them all. I will try to shorten these up a bit.</p>\n<p>One nice quality of a large company is the ability to ruthlessly focus on the one\nthing that interests you and get really good at that. You don't have to worry\nif the servers are working or if payroll is getting down, you just have to focus\non that new piece of infrastructure or feature that you and your team are building.\nYou can build a new language and migrate millions of lines of code to use it,\nyou can build a virtual machine for a language because the transpiled C++ is too\nslow, you can build a unit that shows up in the iOS news feed for particular types\nof stories that your friend's share that have multiple photos attached so that\nthey look and feel nicer. At a startup, sometimes you have to ssh into your production\nservers and manually run queries against the single db because some client can't figure\nout how to log in and you haven't built a robust password reset system yet, you\nsometimes have to do things you have no idea how to simply because they need to get\ndone, now. It is these opportunities to do anything and everything it takes that I\nwas looking for. I love going deep on a single problem, I know what it feels like,\ntrust me. I don't really fully know what it is like to figuratively live or die based\non how well you can do a ton of different things. I want that. I don't think I could\ntruly get that at Facebook, nor do I think it should even be possible. The entire\npoint of a well established and well run company is to abstract those things and\nallow people to use their comparative advantages to help you win. I hope I can make\nmy new company one that people say it is too easy to work here, but I want to be part\nof building that.</p>\n<h3>Quality vs Quantity</h3>\n<p>I don't have much to say here other than I think Facebook, no matter how much some\npeople try and no matter how much people claim to want to change this, has an unhealthy\nobsession with quantity at the cost of quality. There are exceptions you could point\nout, and you could even make a case that there are reasons to believe this is changing,\nbut I don't think it is. From the top down and from the bottom up, most people there\ncan only think in terms of quantity.</p>\n<h3>Monetary Considerations</h3>\n<p>I want to talk here purely about money. Ignore everything else, let's just focus purely\non money and leave all other \"oh but what about this experience\" stuff to the other\nsections. Also I am going to talk purely within the world that is Silicon Valley\nin the early half of the 2010s for a person with my background and experience. That\nmeans for instance that I would call certain salaries small even though they would\nput me in the top 10% of earners in the US.</p>\n<p>If the startup I have gone to is unsuccessful, I will stand to have traded\noff whatever potential salary I would have made at Facebook plus whatever stock\nI would have vested over the time period from now until said failure versus my salary\nat this new company. Let's just say that the difference in salary is really not all that\nmuch, they both meet my needs and I only recently was promoted at Facebook to a point\nwhere my salary was actually a decent amount of money. I don't want to get into it\ntoo much here, but I made a poor decision and I think Facebook took advantage of my\nignorance when I started to the point that I did get some stock but not enough to keep\nme interested in staying as if it was something that would be too much to lose in\nthe aforementioned trade-off. If the startup I have gone to is even moderately successful\nI will stand to make more from equity than I would have gotten from Facebook over the\nsame time period and the salary difference again will be marginal to non-existent.</p>\n<p>Let's consider the worst case scenario for me, something ridiculous happens where I work\nfor several years on this startup and then it fails spectacularly rendering all of my\nequity worthless. In that situation, I go get a job at Facebook, Google, Twitter, some\ndifferent small startup, or I start my own company, or even still I could go into\nfinance if we are talking purely about money. The only thing lost is then a few years of\nnegligible Facebook stock and some time value. I am young enough where that isn't the\nend of the world.</p>\n<p>Hence, from a purely monetary perspective, it makes absolutely no sense to stay at\nFacebook. Even if I absolutely killed it, and did \"better\" than every single engineer\nthere for multiple years in a row, you can compute how much money that would be worth,\nand it just isn't worth it, from an expected value perspective. (I understand my\nbuilt-in positive bias for my new company, which is not justified based on historical\ndata, but such is life).</p>\n<h3>Size</h3>\n<p>I want a smaller environment, Facebook always felt way too big to me, and when I left\nI had been there longer than 68% of the current employees.</p>\n<h3>The Analytics Org</h3>\n<p>I was hired at Facebook into the Finance org as a Quantitative Business Analyst, which\nis funny on many levels. Within a few months of my joining, Facebook hired Ken Rudin\nfrom Zynga to become the head of a new org known as Analytics. Well not exactly,\nbut that is what eventually happened, I forget exactly the organization structure at\nthe beginning, I went from Finance to Growth and then to Analytics, and my title\nchanged rather quickly to Data Scientist, which I will get back to. Nevertheless,\nmy team had a meeting with my manager's manager's new manager, Ken, within his first\nweek there. The result of this meeting was that I realized a few things: I was going\nto leave Facebook immediately or change to engineering, and Facebook was going to\nfail miserably because of this guy they hired. I was wrong about both, for the time\nbeing. I was reassured that I did not need to leave, that nothing would actually change,\nbecause I had a manager insulating me from any real changes and he was determined to\nkeep operating the same way. So I stopped looking for jobs and kept working. But slowly,\nthings did change, it was always minor, I always complained about it, but the changes\nwere never enough to really rage quit over so I kept going.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I took a step back and looked at where Facebook stood in terms of the\ngroup of people looking at data and the goals/purpose of those teams. There has been a\nData Science team for a long time, which consisted of a small set of people with PhDs\nthat spent most of their time working on social science research with the intention\nof publishing a fair amount of their work. They also built some tools that are used\nacross different teams in addition to spinning out a few teams dedicated to things\nlike ensuring the systems used for measuring events was correct and scalable. At some\npoint after the analytics org was formed, there was some political maneuvering and\nsome bickering which led to a new group of people getting the title Data Scientist.\nThese were the people in the analytics org who had also gone through the engineering\nbootcamp when they joined. It was deemed that data scientists were just analysts who\ncould also code. However, going through bootcamp and being able to code are not actually\nsynonymous. The people at the top of analytics, being ignorant of what both data\nscientists and analysts do, made this decision mostly as a recruiting tool. People at\nother companies were being called data scientists and were turning down Facebook\noffers for roles as analysts. So let them have the title. Well, this seriously\noffended the team formerly known as Data Science, but the reason was not understood\nby those who made this decision. The reason this is offensive has to do with guilt\nby association, roughly. If I interact with only one person with a particular title,\nsay as an engineer working with a data scientist, and that person is terrible, I\nwill naturally view the next data scientist I come across in a slightly negative light.\nNow that is generalizing, but everyone does it. I got this same type of stereotype\napplied to me when people found out I was in the analytics org because of the\ninteractions they had had with analysts.</p>\n<p>I was not on the Data Science team, I didn't know there was a distinction before I\njoined Facebook. I was sold on the concept that it was all the same thing, just that\nI would mostly be working on problems related to the product rather than writing\npapers. This was fine with me because if I wanted to be writing papers I would have\nstayed in academics. However, I was misled, and things only got worse. The analytics\norg at Facebook has so many problems that I don't really want to go into all of them\nhere. One major consequence of these problems though is that all of the good people\neither move to engineering or leave the company. I know of at least 8 people who have\nleft the analytics org because of these problems. That might not sound like a lot, but\nthose are the ones I can think of off the top of my head who I have sat down and had\na conversation about these things with. I know there are even more than that.</p>\n<p>I should say that there are a ton of really smart people in the analytics org, a lot\nof them who I would say are there due to a bait and switch. There are many who are\nquite happy with what they are doing because things are actually highly product\nspecific. However, the vast majority are not happy with the way things are being run\nand are looking to leave. Before leaving this too negative, I do want to point out\nthat I had a really good manager when I was in analytics which made my time there\nactually pretty enjoyable because he isolated me from much of the day to day annoyance\nof these problems. But my issues were larger than just my day to day, they had more\nto do with a broken incentive structure and with a misguided value system. I also\nworked with a ton of people who are still there doing great work. And I should also\nnote that the core Data Science team is still there and have mostly been unaffected\nby these issues. Everyone on that team that I have come across is very good, so I\nfind it is an additional insult to them that they are associated with the problems\nof the analytics org that stem from that org calling everyone the same title as them.</p>\n<h3>Product/Purpose</h3>\n<p>I am excited about the role Flexport plays in the world. Facebook as a product has\nalways cut two ways for me. On the one hand I think connecting the world and making\nit more open is one of the great achievements of the past 100 years. On the other hand,\nwhen I see how people actually use the product and the concepts being worked on\ninternally, I am underwhelmed. I am more interested in fixing something that is broken\nand has real value, rather than making it marginally easier to show people pictures\nof my dogs.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Something new","date":"03 May 2014","categories":"life","tags":["life","career","work","facebook"]},"timeToRead":12,"wordCount":{"words":3258},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2014-05-03-something-new.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2014-05-03-something-new/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
