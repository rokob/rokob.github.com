I had some time being sick to\ndo some reading so I decided to pull it off the shelf and read it.</p>\n<p>I knew the basic premise of the book and it did not disappoint. More or less I understand and agree\nwith the concept. Some of the style of this type of book always rubs me the wrong way. Telling me\nabout some rich guy doing something as an example of why it is a good idea doesn't always sit well\nwith me as an argument. But nonetheless there were other sources of reasoning which confirmed my\npreexisting biases towards the importance of doing work that is effortful and deep. I have mostly\ndisconnected myself from the normal distractions that other people fight with so I have less to\nimplement after reading this. However, I still am not doing as much deep work as I would like and\nreading this helped me realize that and motivated me to put more effort into creating opportunities\nfor this type of work in my day to day life.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Deep Work","date":"05 Nov 2024","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":188},"fields":{"sha":"77883d416fc1ebdc6e6053e5bbfa7e738033c431"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2024-11-05-deep-work.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2024-11-05-deep-work/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
