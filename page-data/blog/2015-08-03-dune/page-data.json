Well,\nI had heard of it as this classic science fiction\nnovel, but I did not know anything about it, nor\nthe whole culture around it. For the first time in\na while a classic has really lived up to it's billing,\nthis is a really great book.</p>\n<p><em>Dune</em> is long in terms of page count and complex\nin terms of invented culture and logos, but ultimately\nit was not long or detailed enough to satisfy me. Don't get\nme wrong, I was satisfied with the book, but there is\nso much more that could have been added just to fill\nin more details. I am definitely going to add the next\ncouple books in the series to my list.</p>\n<p>Here is a science fiction book that does not rely too\nheavily on just the novelty of the future or technology\nto carry the story. Sure, most of the story revolves around\nthings that do not exist today, at least to a first\napproximation. However, the majority of the book is metaphorically\nthe same as all of human history including today. There are\nstruggles over power, there are resources that some have\nand some do not, there are flawed and complex people, there\nexists ignorance and bigotry, love and war. These are all\nthemes you can relate to even if they happen to be personified\nin sandpeople 8000 years in the future on a planet that is\nnot earth.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dune","date":"03 Aug 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":256},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-08-03-dune.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-08-03-dune/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
