Obviously the authors don't claim this is the\nonly reason, but it stands to reason that a homogenous country might have developed a relatively\nhomogenous parenting style.</p>\n<p>The book is quite short and easy to read. They also <a href=\"http://thedanishway.com/\">have a website</a> which has some extra\ninformation related to the book. It reads as if they had something like a short pamphlet which they\nfleshed out into a book. This isn't necessarily bad, just saying that it is not of the same caliber\nof story or material as say <a href=\"/blog/2018-06-29-bringing-up-bebe/\"><em>Bringing Up Bebe</em></a>.</p>\n<p>There is an acronym that drives this book: PARENT. Play. Authenticity. Reframing. Empathy. No\nUltimatums. Togetherness and Hygge. I won't recount the whole book, but I agree with most of what\nthey say and it jives pretty well with  <em>Bringing Up Bebe</em> and <a href=\"/blog/2018-03-22-the-blessing-of-a-skinned-knee/\"><em>The Blessing of a Skinned Knee</em></a>.\nIt is worth reading mostly because it only takes a couple hours and the material is easy to digest\nand see how you can implement it. I would say that this book could be expanded quite a bit and the\nwriting could be quite a bit better.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Danish Way of Parenting","date":"04 Jul 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","nonfiction","okay","parenting"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":229},"fields":{"sha":"3a23f0ef6a8f1235cb8656de6d03275c3729a226"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-07-04-the-danish-way-of-parenting.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-07-04-the-danish-way-of-parenting/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
