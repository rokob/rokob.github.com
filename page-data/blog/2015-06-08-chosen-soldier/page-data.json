This was the state\nof affairs as of around 2004 and the basic structure is still the same.\nThere is also a bit of history of special forces and unconventional warfare\nin general.</p>\n<p>The 18X program, which was created in the last 10-15 years, is basically\nthe equivalent of the SEAL challenge contract. Much of this book follows\na class of \"X-Rays\", as they are typically called, through OSUT, SOPC, SFAS,\nand the Q course. The real training is done in the Q course. SFAS is the 35 day\nselection course that determines who goes on to the main training course and who\ngets dropped or recycled. Selection is what I have heard is the \"toughest\" part\nof the entire program in that once you make it through that point your odds of success\ndramatically increase. Clearly the whole program has varying amounts of\ndifficulty, but statistically selection is the weeding out point.</p>\n<p>The book was well written and achieved its main goal of explaining how SF\ntraining and selection goes down. Obviously, there are many parts that\nhad to be glossed over for security reasons, not to mention parts that are\ncontinually evolving which implies that what you read today is not\nnecessarily what one would go through tomorrow.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Chosen Soldier","date":"08 Jun 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","military","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":226},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-06-08-chosen-soldier.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-06-08-chosen-soldier/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
