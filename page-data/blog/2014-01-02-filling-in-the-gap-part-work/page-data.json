My last post was on July 30, 2012\nin which I discussed the fact that we moved down from San Francisco to Redwood\nCity. Interestingly I managed to recover that post and will put it up here\npretty soon when I get a chance.</p>\n<p>So we moved to the suburbs, although in Silicon Valley because of where many of\nthe companies are, there is a bit of an inverted city/suburb dynamic so the\nsuburbs here are a bit different than in some other places, while at the same\ntime they are really very similar. For one, many people live in the city and\ncommute out for work, so often people live in the suburbs to avoid a commute\nwhich is a non-traditional trade off. On the other hand, it is boring and there\nare lots of family friendly things to do, so it is very traditional in that\nsense. We live in Redwood Shores which is closer to San Carlos than Redwood\nCity, but that is my address so whatever.</p>\n<p>Last you heard from me I was working as a Data Scientist at Facebook. I was\nworking on problems with Site Integrity mainly around fake accounts, spam, and\ngeneral account access (i.e. login, password recover, etc.). I have a lot to\nsay about Data Science or more accurately Analytics at Facebook, but I would\nprefer not to say them until after I no longer work there. I don't really care\ntoo much about how people there would react to what I have to say, I just don't\nthink it is right for me to say certain things in full because they are not all\nthat positive. I will write down my thoughts somewhere and save it so that I\ndon't have to look back and try to remember, but I won't publish anything until\nafter I leave. Anywho, I decided that I was not happy with the direction I was\nheaded nor with the overall work that I was involved in, but I still liked\nworking at Facebook a lot. I wanted to get back into purely writing code and\nbuilding things rather than analyzing what other people were building. I wasn't\npositive that I would be able to find what I was looking for at Facebook, but I\nhad only been there a few months and I was pretty convinced that my general\nmalaise had to do with the work I was doing (or lack thereof) rather than the\nplace itself. So even though I did talk to a few other places and look around a\nlittle, I decided to focus on finding something internally. I had played around\nwith Android through a Big Nerd Ranch course at work and some hackathon\nprojects, which really turned me on to mobile development, but I really don't\nlike Java and the Android ecosystem did not excite me that much. So I started\nto look into Objective-C and iOS. Eventually I sent an email to someone I was\nin bootcamp with who directed me to the manager of our iOS core team.</p>\n<p>We have a think called a hackamonth where you can go work on a team for a month\nto try it out and possibly switch or possibly just go back to what you were\nworking on. You can only do this after working for a year and you can only do\nit so frequently, so I knew I had to wait until after February of 2013 to make\na switch. Therefore, I tried to wrap up what I was working on as best as I\ncould and started planning to move over to iOS. I met with the manager of the\ncore team and a couple of the guys on the team, and it seemed like exactly what\nI was looking for. The only downside was that I had zero iOS experience, and I\nhadn't written any serious C/C++ in a couple years. In addition to zero iOS\nexperience, I had zero Objective-C experience. I bought two books, one on iOS\nand another on the language itself, and worked through them on nights and\nweekends. I may have embellished a little bit to the people I spoke to about my\nbackground in these areas only because I know I can learn extrememly quickly\nand I have found that because most people cannot they assume that it is not\npossible to go from nothing to productive as fast as I know I can. So I worked\nout the logistics and had the hackamonth as my extended interview for iOS and\nstarted on April 1 of 2013.</p>\n<p>I had a few projects during the month which I was able to accomplish to\neveryone's satisfaction which made it easy for me to stay on the team and\nbecome a full time iOS software engineer. Over the past 9 months working on\niOS, I have learned an absolute shit ton about the platform and the language. I\nhave also had to grow my bag of software engineering tricks especially in the\nareas of design patterns and concurrency. Over the past 3 or 4 months I have\nbeen focusing exclusively on mobile networking which has been an entirely new\nset of things for me to learn. I don't mean it in a bragging way, but I do\nlearn very quickly, so I would say that I am now quite productive on the team,\nnot quite at the level of the guys who have been doing this for years, but I\nwould feel comfortable in any iOS codebase or taking on nearly any size\nproject in Objective-C at this point. I have been immensely happy with this new\nrole, so much so that although I have considered what I might do elsewhere, I\nhave a lot that I can envision doing at Facebook that I don't really see myself\nleaving soon.</p>\n<p>That is the short version of my work life for the past 18 months. As I am still\nnot the best at understanding properitary from public I am going to defer\nsaying too much more in detail. Nonetheless, I see a ton of exciting\nopportunities in iOS over the next year or so that I am glad to be working on.\nIn the longer term, I am thrilled to be developing some good engineering skills\nby working on infrastructure. Oh I forgot to mention that, what used to be\nknown as the core team, is now known as iOS Product Infrastructure, to more\nclosely align with sister teams on Android and the web which do similar cross\ncutting engineering. We write code as if the product engineers at Facebook are\nour clients, so we build abtractions and systems that make them more productive\nas well as solve problems in the general rather than having each group have to\nsolve the same things over and over. It is a really great place to learn a lot\nabout the practical design of software because if you fuck up an API it becomes\nevident very quickly because of the pain it causes hundreds of other engineers.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Filling in the gap - Work","date":"02 Jan 2014","categories":"update","tags":["life","past"]},"timeToRead":5,"wordCount":{"words":1215},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2014-01-02-filling-in-the-gap-part-work.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2014-01-02-filling-in-the-gap-part-work/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
