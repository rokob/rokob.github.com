But, I decided to read\n<a href=\"http://amzn.com/0061339202\"><em>Flow</em></a> based on a recommendation, and while\nit definitely fits all of the aforementioned categories that I\nusually dislike, I found this to be an enjoyable and enlightening\nread.</p>\n<p>Flow is really just an all-encompassing term that means a lot more\nthan the colloquial meaning that you might be familiar with. Flow\nis essentially the optimal mental state of being wherein you experience\na sense of higher order happiness that occurs when you are in the\ndelicate middle ground between anxiety with being in over your head\nand boredom with being under utilized. Sports are prototypical examples\nof where flow experiences are common. Rowing is one place where I have\nclearly felt this. When you first start rowing in eights, there is a choice\nbetween rowing all 8, or having 2, 4, or even 6 people sit out to steady\nthe boat. When you haven't learned how to set the boat, rowing all 8 puts\nyou on the side of anxiety where you are doing something that is beyond\nyour skill level. When you only have one pair rowing, you can quickly get\nin the state of boredom. In fact with rowing you can easily get bored rowing\nsixes because having the training wheels of one pair setting the boat\nis about all you really need. The state of flow is occurs as you get\nbetter moving along the axis of boredom and then taking a leap upwards\nin difficulty along the axis of anxiety. Somewhere as you vacillate between\nthese two states you get into a state of flow. As you get better at what\nyou are doing, being in flow requires increasing levels of difficulty to stave\nof boredom but just the right amount to avoid being in a problematic state.</p>\n<p>The book goes into a lot of examples of flow situations, discussions\nof happiness and how control over consciousness is the key to achieving it.\nI got the impression that the main point was that being \"autotelic\" is\nthe way to achieve flow and a happy life. An autotelic experience is\n\"a self-contained activity, one that is done not with the expectation\nof some future benefit, but simply because the doing itself is the reward.\"\nThere is also the notion of an autotelic personality which is related\nto how self-conscious someone is and in particular the ability of an individual\nto control their attention.</p>\n<p>I find that I have more or less lived my life in search of flow experiences, but\nI have not really isolated before that this was going on. The main issue is that\nI quickly come to a point where I get into a state of boredom with a situation\nand it is hard to internally make another jump in the difficulty level. Usually\nthis makes me want to find a new thing to re-experience the transition from what\nthis book calls anxiety to boredom.</p>\n<p>Overall the book was pretty good at illuminating the particular state of mind\nthat I have found to be most enjoyable in my past experience. When I learned\nmost was that there are quite a few strategies for achieving flow, as well as\nnatural situations where flow is more or less likely to occur.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Flow","date":"06 Jun 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","nonfiction","personality","life"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":569},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-06-06-flow.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-06-06-flow/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
