I now feel that you have to read all three to really\nappreciate the first novel.</p>\n<p>I wonder if people who write multiple part series think upfront that\nthey are going to write a triology, or in the Harry Potter case a colleciton\nof seven books. It is not necessary to plan this ahead of time. If one does then\nit makes it easier to foreshadow across multiple novels. On the other hand,\nI imagine writing a single, self-contained novel is not only eaier, but also\nallows you some freedom to take the stor wherever it feels write to take it.\nThe difficulty must be in the ending. There is the question of whether to\nensure all threads are tied up at the end, or if it is okay to just let things\nremain open ended as long as there is a satisfying ending. That is easier\nsaid than done, but I think each Dune book that I've read so far has ended\nin a way that allows the book to stand on it's own.</p>\n<p>The one issue I had with this book is that I think I might have to read it\nagain at some point because there was so much that was left unexplained\nand meant to be understood just by context. I personally love this style\nof story telling and have a bit of a disdain for plot devices that are\nthere just to explain terminology or concepts in an imaginary universe.\nBut the flip side to that coin is the necessity to make conceptual leaps\nand use a lot of memory to make connections and clarifications to previous\nconcepts as you get more information later in the story.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend this book, however you absolute cannot read it by itself,\nyou must read the first two books before this one. In reality, I think\nthey are really just one long book that happens to be broken into three parts.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Children of Dune","date":"09 Dec 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":360},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-12-09-children-of-dune.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-12-09-children-of-dune/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
