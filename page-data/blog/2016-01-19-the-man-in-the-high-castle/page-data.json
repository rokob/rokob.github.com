Seriously, I might have to read it again or just\nthink about it for a while before I really understand what the\nhell happened. Nonetheless, it was pretty good.</p>\n<p>Yet another Philip K. Dick novel where I have the distinct feeling\nthat I do not want to read any more of his books any time soon,\nand yet I probably will keep reading more of them. They are not\nmasterpieces but they really get under your skin. <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>\non the surface is about an alternate universe where the Germans\nand Japanese won the war and have therefore divided up the world.\nThe book has several characters that are existing in this world and going\nabout their alternate universe lives. In this alternate universe\nthere is a book about an alternate universe where the Allies won\nthe war. So you are a reading a book in the universe where the Allies won\nthe war about a universe where\nthe Axis won the war which contains a book about a universe where the\nAllies won the war. And yet it is more complicated that even that\nexplanation. I do not like complicated for the sake of complication;\ncomplex due to natural complexity is fine, I like that. I think\nthis book is more on the complex side of things, but that certainly\ndoes not make it any easier to comprehend and follow.</p>\n<p>If you like PKD then you will probably love this book, in fact\nyou have probably already read it. Also, if you\nwant to put some time into reading something thinking you have\nit all figured out until the last 20 pages when you get your world\nturned upside down and left hanging, then you will like this\nbook. On the other hand, if you want something straight forward\nor linear to comprehend, then steer clear of this. In fact,\nyou probabyl should stay away from PKD all together, because\neven if you think you understand what is going on, there is\nprobably some underlying truth that you have yet to grasp.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Man in the High Castle","date":"19 Jan 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":386},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-01-19-the-man-in-the-high-castle.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-01-19-the-man-in-the-high-castle/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
