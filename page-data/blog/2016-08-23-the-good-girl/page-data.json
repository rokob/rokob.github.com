It was a decent book, at times trying way to hard to be better than\nit is, but there was enough there to keep my interest and want to know how it was going to end.</p>\n<p>The style of the book is where each chapter is set before or after Mia returning home and narrated\nby one of a few different characters. You therefore have to piece things together from the different\ntime frames and perspectives with the final details being revealed very late in the book. This is a\nsomewhat standard formula now for these types of thrillers which does not really bother me. I am not\nsure if I can say that I like this style per se, but it definitely makes what would otherwise be an\narguably boring linear narrative more interesting. In other words, I think it takes more work to\ntell a linear story and make it captivating compared to jumping around between narrators and time\nframes. There is a bit more work to be done by the reader pieceing together hints here and there\nabout what is going to happen. That being said, there is a certain amount of skill involved with\nhaving some twists and turns throughout even though at some points you know how something is\ngenerically going to turn out given that you are reading part of the book set after a particular\nevent.</p>\n<p>I would not go so far as to put this on par with <em>Gone Girl</em>, but if you liked that book or <em>The\nGirl on the Train</em>, then you might find this to be worth reading. In no way is it a must read, but\nit should hold your attention for a few hours.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Good Girl","date":"23 Aug 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","fiction","good"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":311},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-08-23-the-good-girl.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-08-23-the-good-girl/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
