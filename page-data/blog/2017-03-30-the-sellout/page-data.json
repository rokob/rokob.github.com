This is really a hard book to describe. I could give you\na plot summary, but that wouldn't really capture what the book is about. The short version is that\nyou really should read this book, and let yourself laugh even if for some reason you don't think you\nshould.</p>\n<p>There are so many good lines in this book, both funny as well as witty, for instance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like Nazis at a Ku Klux Klan rally, they were comfortable ideologically, but not in terms of\ncorporate culture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If that doesn't get you to put this on your reading list then I do not know what will. I had never\nheard of the Man Booker Prize, but after I did and I heard that this book one with an American\nauthor for the first time, I figured I would check it out. I am really glad that I did.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Sellout","date":"30 Mar 2017","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":167},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2017-03-30-the-sellout.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017-03-30-the-sellout/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
