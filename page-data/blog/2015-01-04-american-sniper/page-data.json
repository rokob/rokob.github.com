The fact that the movie version is coming out\nin a couple weeks spurred me to finally read <a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/dp/0062376330\"><em>American Sniper</em></a>.\nIt was a very good book, not necessarily what I would call a great\npiece of literature, but it was well written, it had a\ngeneral overarching theme that tied together nicely, and most importantly,\nit was clearly an authentic portrait of his life.</p>\n<p>I have considered joining the military at various points in my\nlife, but for one reason or another I never did. This is the\nfirst thing that has pushed enough of the right\nbuttons in my mind to seriously consider it again. I have my own\nreasons, but hearing his process leading up to becoming\na SEAL, his personal motivations, as well as the stories of\nfighting in Iraq, it was all actually pretty motivational.\nI am pondering the possibility of how that might fit in\nwith the rest of the shit that I am doing, but to be honest,\nit seems like a great thing to do right now.</p>\n<p>One aspect of this book that really struck me was how much\nhe talked about enjoying his profession of warfare. Maybe it is\njust because I haven't read too many military books that were\nwritten by the actual guys on the ground, but this attitude\ntowards military action has always been how I thought I would\nfeel, but I've just never heard it echoed before. Clearly\nthere were moments of tragedy which are part of the reality\nof war, but this book was the first that felt balanced to me.\nThis even perspective between both the potentially positive\nand negative aspects of fighting our nation's enemies was\nrefreshing.</p>\n<p>I am not sure how the movie is going to turn out compared to\nthe book. Sadly, he died before the movie was made, which meant\nthey reworked some of it to include parts of his life after the book.\nAlso, I have heard mixed things about the movie depending on\nwhether you know anything about realistic military training and\ncombat situations or not. As I do not, I feel the movie will not\nstrike me as too inaccurate, but as long as it is close to the book,\nI have a feeling it will be pretty good. I will try to revisit\nthis after seeing the movie to see how they compare.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"American Sniper","date":"04 Jan 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","military","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":422},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-01-04-american-sniper.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-01-04-american-sniper/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
