I bought it and it has been\nsitting on my Kindle until recently I decided I might as well give it a go. On one hand, this book\nwas amazing. It explanined very clearly a method of writing to get your point across effectively. On\nthe other hand, for a short book about writing less, it could have easily been half as long.</p>\n<p>I am interested in using this style of writing in certain places. Clearly I am not using it here\nwhile writing this. But I have already started using it at work a bit and it does work. I have an\nidea for a separate blog I guess you would call it that I procrastinate on writing due to not\nfeeling like I have time. But my thought is to experiment writing in this style. Howver, the old\nMark Twin adage definitely applies \"I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a\nlong one instead.\"</p>\n<p>Let's see if I actually do this and how it goes. I already was thinking about writing something and\nI realized the key to \"Smart Brevity\" is actually knowing what you want to say. It is easy for me to\nwrite a lot even when (maybe especially when) I don't fully understand the point I am trying to get\nacross. Distilling your main point down into a single sentence requies you to know what that one\npoint is. So I am going to give this a go with the constraints defined in the book as a guideline.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Smart Brevity","date":"15 Aug 2025","categories":"book","tags":["book","business","nonfiction","okay","writing"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":267},"fields":{"sha":"9bf922022a4f360afab30761c7869c7a0e7336a9"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2025-08-15-smart-brevity.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2025-08-15-smart-brevity/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
