I was thinking that I had\nseen the movie but after reading it I don't think I did. I think I saw parts of the beginning and\nnever really made it through. I have seen this book around and knew about the movie, but I never\nexpected it to be so good. I read a bit about Patricia Highsmith afterwards and I am now excited to\nread some more things that she wrote. I won't say anymore as this is just a really good book and I\nam so happy I read it without knowing how all the twists and turns play out.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Talented Mr. Ripley","date":"16 Apr 2021","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":115},"fields":{"sha":"62444f18444516a0eb89b3577b7f77849b2f5963"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2021-04-16-the-talented-mr-ripley.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2021-04-16-the-talented-mr-ripley/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
