It is super weird. I am not really sure how I feel about it to\nbe honest. There were large chunks that just made no sense. I mean that I understood what the author\nwas trying to do, but the random introduction of arbitrary concepts did not add to my enjoyment of\nthe story.</p>\n<p>The book as a whole is a decent read if you do not have anything else to do and you do not mind\nstrange scifi. I think I need to read some more of the books in the series to get a more accurate\nfeel for what is going on. However, parts that were probably meant to be clever and original I found\nto be blaise. I recommend a lot of other books before this one, but I would not go so far as to call\nthis bad.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Color of Magic","date":"22 Sep 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","okay","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":164},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-09-22-the-color-of-magic.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-09-22-the-color-of-magic/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
