There\nwas a lot of talk about the Hilary Clinton email garbage which made\nthe whole investigation into Benghazi seem to be lost in the background.\nAfter seeing the preview, I came across <a href=\"http://amzn.com/145558228X\"><em>13 Hours</em></a> in an\nairport book store which surprised me as I did not know it was a\nbook before I heard about the movie. This made it onto my reading\nlist and I just got around to it thankfully in time before the movie\nhits theatres.</p>\n<p>I knew very little about what happened in Libya on September 11, 2012\nso this book was one of those enjoyable occasions where I got to read\na nonfiction book about something that both interests me as well as\nthat I know virtually nothing about. The media coverage for the past\nhalf year or so has focused so much on Hilary Clinton that the actual\nevents that took place during those 13 hours seems lost. I knew that\nsome people died but I did not know who, how many, or why. After reading\nthis book I have a much better understanding of what happened, although\nas you would also find out after reading, we still do not really know\nthe full details of the why.</p>\n<p>That should be ammended to say we do not know necessarily why the\ncompound in Libya was attacked in the first place, but we do know\nthat there were some critical mistakes and decisions that led to\ncasualties in some respects but also decisions that led to more\npeople being saved than otherwise.</p>\n<p>Some other facts that came out of this book that I found particuarly\nintersting is the interplay between\nthe different official government agencies and contract operators.\nIf you want to know a detailed account of what happened on the ground\nthis is the best way to find out. If you are looking for some\nanswers to political questions or really detailed analysis of the\ncauses or consequences of the attack then this is not the book\nfor you. Overall it was a well written narrative if not a bit\nrepeatitive at times. I would have liked to have a bit more\ndiscussion about the aftermath, but that really was not the\npurpose of the book so I should not fault it for that.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"13 Hours","date":"16 Nov 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","military","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":407},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-11-16-13-hours.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-11-16-13-hours/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
