Once again he strikes just the right balance between getting the scientific details\nright and telling a great story. Just like his other book, I had trouble putting this down until I\nwas through with it.</p>\n<p>One point that somehow stood out is that the protagonist is female. This is revealed early in the\nbook, but probably due to some inate bias I assumed she was male until it was explicitly called out.\nThere was an actual moment where I was surprised and had to rethink the first part of the book\nwherein I had assumed she was a he.</p>\n<p>Science fiction stories that rely heavily on the novelty of their difference from our currently\nreality bother me. I'm usually not interested in reading something that is just about how some\nalternate reality is different. This was not in that vein, rather the plot stands by itself and just\nis enhanced by the novelty of the surrounding world. He also did a good job of working in the\ndetails of what you want to know about this fictious world without being overly pedantic.
