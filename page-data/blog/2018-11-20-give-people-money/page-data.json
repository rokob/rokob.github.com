However, it is a rehash of a lot of things I already know and have read\nfrom other sources so it wasn't the best book for me. I also think there are other sources which are\nmore in depth on some topics which is really necessary for getting in to some of the important data.\nI am done reading these popular audience UBI books as I am not the target audience and I am no\nlonger getting anything terribly useful out of them.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Give People Money","date":"20 Nov 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","nonfiction","okay","society"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":123},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-11-20-give-people-money.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-11-20-give-people-money/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
