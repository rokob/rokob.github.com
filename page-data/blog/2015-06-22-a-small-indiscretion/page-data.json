It was surely entertaining in that sense.\nOn the other hand, I can only read one book like this with many others\nas buffer in the middle because the amount of whining, self-loathing,\nand weakness is quite draining. I find it hard to identify with these\ncharacters just because they are so morally shallow. But, if\nyou can work past some of that nonsense, you might find it to be a\ndecent page turner.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Small Indiscretion","date":"22 Jun 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","relationships"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":181},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-06-22-a-small-indiscretion.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-06-22-a-small-indiscretion/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
