Although the book was not ridiculously long (around\n900 pages), it was long enough that it took me almost a month to read when combined\nwith my recent decrease in time that I can devote to reading. The book a week plan\ntook a serious hit in April because I only managed to read this one book. Hopefully I\ncan make up for lost time going forward.</p>\n<p><em>Cryptonomicon</em> is a mix of historical fiction and I guess you would call it science\nfiction. There are things which did not exist when the book is written, such as crypto\ncurrencies, which now make the book seem less sci-fi and more just alternate reality.\nThe narrative jumped back and forth in space and time across several different characters\nwhich made for some mental gymnastic to keep everything straight in my head. As someone\nwho has at least a passing familiarity for information theory, cryptography, and other\nmathematical and technical topics that were relevant to the story, I felt that the book\nwas very understandable and mostly believable. I can imagine someone who is unaware of\nAlan Turing or the code breaking work that went on in during World War II to be lost\nat times. Nevertheless, there is a lot of human interest to the story wherein the code\nbreaking is mostly part of the backdrop.</p>\n<p>The book is full of foreshadowing which can sometimes be lame because either nothing\ngets tied together well in the end, or everything gets tied together but hastily, or\nthe end is boring because the foreshadowing gave everything interesting away. This book\nsuffers from almost none of those problems. The author is very good to give just enough\ninformation away to guide you towards what is going to happen, but not enough to take away\nall the surprise. This is quite the challenge considering half the story takes places 50 years\nbefore the other half. The end was not hasty like some similar books tend to be,\nprobably why it took 900 pages to tell the whole thing.</p>\n<p>I would not call this book \"great\" in that it is not a must read for everyone. However,\nit is on the border between good and great, and definitely something I would recommend\nto anyone who is interested in some good WWII and cryptography related historical\nfiction.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cryptonomicon","date":"04 May 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","fiction","history","military"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":403},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-05-06-cryptonomicon.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-05-06-cryptonomicon/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
