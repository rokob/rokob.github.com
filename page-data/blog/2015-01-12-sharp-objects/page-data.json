It was the kind of book that was\nreally hard to put down, and more than anything, the style\nwas incredibly relatable. Often I find it difficult to relate\nto characters or themes because I find them to be fake or\noutlandish, but for some reason <em>Gone Girl</em> made sense\nto me. As an aside, I still haven't seen the movie but I\nhear it is pretty good and I really want to see it, just\nhaven't gotten around to it yet. Long story short, I knew\nthat Gillian Flynn had other books, so threw one on my\nreading list and it just happened to be <a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/dp/0307341550\"><em>Sharp Objects</em></a>.</p>\n<p>This was a very good book. Not the kind of thing that will\nbe studied in literature courses in 100 years, but it\nwas my kind of story. It had my kind of characters. And it\nwas told in a way that I really enjoy. Maybe being from\nthe Midwest makes stories set in that region easier to\ndigest, I am not sure. I recommend this book to anyone,\nalthough you probably have to be comfortable with\n\"adult themes\".</p>\n<p>On one hand this was just a old time murder mystery, but\non the other hand, this was a story of getting older\nwhile never really growing up. A story about the long lasting\nripples in people's lives that result from tragic events.\nMoreover, there is an interesting play between the power of\nactions as well as the power of a lack of action. That not doing\nsomething can sometimes be just as powerful as an overt act.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of emotional issues at play in this book,\nmany of which relate to the mother-daughter relationship.\nI did not feel a lack of understanding even though I clearly\nlack any direct experience of this. Perhaps I just find it\neasier to empathize or understand people who are a little\non the messed up side of life.</p>\n<p>I won't give anything away, but similar to <em>Gone Girl</em>, <em>Sharp Objects</em>\nhas a lot of twists and turns, and what I would call a couple\nsurprises. Definitely hard to put down.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sharp Objects","date":"12 Jan 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","crime"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":370},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-01-12-sharp-objects.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-01-12-sharp-objects/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
