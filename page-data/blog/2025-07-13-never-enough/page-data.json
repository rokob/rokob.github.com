I just got around to reading it now even though that group was many months ago. I am glad\nI finally read it as it was a quick read and it was an interesting view into the culture of many\n\"high pressure\" school settings.</p>\n<p>I don't think I grew up with that much pressure, I never felt \"stress\" to do well in school. But I\ndid have some of the issues addressed here. I also see how it can be pretty toxic. It was very\ninformative for what to look out for. The writing style got a little tired and the whole book could\nhave probably been half as long, but I know that this is the normal style for this type of book.\nDefinitely worth reading.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Never Enough","date":"13 Jul 2025","categories":"book","tags":["book","children","good","nonfiction","parenting"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":147},"fields":{"sha":"75e616f823a70ce23b7886af790a6cd4ece01500"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2025-07-13-never-enough.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2025-07-13-never-enough/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
