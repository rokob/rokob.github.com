It was good, but not great. Overly literary,\noften times it felt like some sentences were written and then the rest was written around that\nbecause they sounded really neat.</p>\n<p>There was not much story here. Interestingly, there were moments of deep emotion evoked by the\nlanguage, but that is about all I can say.
