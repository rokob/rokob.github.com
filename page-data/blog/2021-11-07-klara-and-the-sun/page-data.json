Part of it is the move, part is just being generally\nbusy with work and the rest of life. I started reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Klara-Sun-novel-Kazuo-Ishiguro-ebook/dp/B08B7V6CQ8\"><em>Klara and the Sun</em></a> a couple\nmonths ago but put it down for quite a while. I finally got around to finishing it and it was quite\ngood. It was original and thought-provoking, but spent too much time on minutiae with the all the\naction packed into too few pages.</p>\n<p>I do recommend this quite a bit. It is hard not to give too much away other than the robot concept\nis executed well. I may have to go back and read more of this work as I think I only\nskimmed enough of <em>Remains of the Day</em> to make it through the relevant tests in English class.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Klara and the Sun","date":"07 Nov 2021","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":138},"fields":{"sha":"3cf1f26c983e2efcf2f002c9b529a95570f9cf85"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2021-11-07-klara-and-the-sun.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2021-11-07-klara-and-the-sun/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
