I understand this sentiment,\nbut I enjoy a fair amount of books written for young adults. I am thus\nsomewhat torn when I pick up something like the <em>Hunger Games</em> because\nI have a nagging feeling like I should not be reading it. I should say I\nused to feel that way, I have evolved to not give a shit about what I\nshould or should not be reading. I read whatever I think I will enjoy,\nregardless of who is the target audience. My bigger issue is that books\nfor children have become popular recently so when I go look for books to\nread or look at lists of books I don't usually find \"adult\" books. So I\nwent looking for adult books to read and it was hard to just find something\nthat was specfically for adults. This is clear in retrospect because a book\nis for whoever can read it, digest it, comprehend the meaning. Shakespeare\ncould be for children because they can certainly read it, but it takes a bit\nof maturity to really comprehend and digest what is going on. After all that,\nI found a mention of the author Megan Abbott in the aforementioned Slate article\nwhich led me to pick up her book <a href=\"http://amzn.com/B000FCJZPE\"><em>Die a Little</em></a>.</p>\n<p><em>Die a Little</em> reminds me of film noir, which apparently is a genre\nknown as hardboiled fiction. I found this to be a good book, better than\na lot of other crap out there, but nowhere near the great category. The characters\nin this book were developed just enough to be understood but not too much\nto be boring. The narrative moved along at a reasonable pace weaving enough\ntwists and turns along the way to make it hard to put down. Overall it was\na short, page turner that falls into that category of women being abused by\nmen and crimes involving women that I keep falling into reading. I really\nhave reasons to pick these up and they just happen to fall into that category.</p>\n<p>I may pick up another book by Megan Abbott later as she apparently has others\nwhich are better, but I am going to steer clear of that genre for at least\none or two books.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Die a Little","date":"13 Nov 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","fiction","good"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":402},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-11-13-die-a-little.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-11-13-die-a-little/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
