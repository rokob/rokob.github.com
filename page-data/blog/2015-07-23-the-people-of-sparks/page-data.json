Thus, I read <a href=\"http://amzn.com/B000FC1R1O\"><em>The People of Sparks</em></a>.\nI knew the first book was written for a younger audience,\nbut that was much more obvious in this second book. The target\nage for this is probably 10-15 years old. It was worse than\nthe first, but still readable.</p>\n<p>This book was predictable to a degree I have not experienced lately.\nIt was almost painful at times to read. Nevertheless, the story was\ncoherent, and it was pretty easy to read. It is still an interesting\nstory to consider life after some kind of nuclear disaster.</p>\n<p>Sparks is a city that the people find after leaving the city of Ember\nwhich happens at the end of the previous book. The people try to be nice,\nthen they are not nice, then they are nice again. That is the whole book.\nIt is probably much more interesting if you are learning the themes of\nhumanity as a 10 year old, but as an adult it left much to be desired.\nI can not really fault the book for that, as I am certainly not the target,\nso for what it is the book was good, which ranks as an okay on my scale.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The People of Sparks","date":"23 Jul 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","okay","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":223},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-07-23-the-people-of-sparks.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-07-23-the-people-of-sparks/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
