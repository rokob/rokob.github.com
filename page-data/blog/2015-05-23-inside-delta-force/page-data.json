What better\nnarrative than from one of the original members?\n<a href=\"http://amzn.com/0812534727\"><em>Inside Delta Force</em></a> was written by Eric Haney who\nwas part of the first couple groups of guys to make it through\nDelta Force selection and become a member of the teams. The book\ncovers selection, training, and a sample of some of their missions\nduring the late 1970s and 1980s.</p>\n<p>I had heard this book was one of the definitive things to read if you were interested\nin how their selection works (or at least worked at one point). It seems to be mostly\na matter of mental attrition through grueling rucksack treks. There is definitely\na physical component to being able to navigate through the woods for hours at a\ntime, day after day. There is no denying that. However, the real challenge seems\nto be mental. For most people, the hardest part has to be pushing yourself, alone, against an unknown standard,\nin pain, always with a way out if you would just say the word. I cannot say one way\nor another how I would stack up against that challenge without being there.</p>\n<p>The next part of the book about their training is pretty crazy. I am sure it is only\na glimpse into what completely goes on. Clearly there are a lot of training methods\nthat are classified, not to mention that things have evolved in the past 30 years\nor so. But, nonetheless, just a glimpse into how they train is serious business.</p>\n<p>The type of missions they go on has also probably evolved quite dramatically\nover time as there are many fewer airplanes being hijacked nowadays. Again\nthis insight into our elite counter terror unit was eye opening. The only\ndownside of the book was the style was pretty similar to American Sniper. By this\nI mean that it was choppy, and written almost like a conversation you would\nhave in a bar, remembering the good ol days. That is not a bad thing per se,\nit is easy to read, but it is a bit simplisitic in style.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Inside Delta Force","date":"23 May 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","history","military","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":367},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-05-23-inside-delta-force.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-05-23-inside-delta-force/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
