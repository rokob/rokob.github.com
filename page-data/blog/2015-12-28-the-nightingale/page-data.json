However, now that I have finished\n<a href=\"http://amzn.com/B00JO8PEN2\"><em>The Nightingale</em></a> I am sorry that I delayed picking\nit up for as long as I did. This was really a moving piece of\nhistoric fiction.</p>\n<p>Although the themes of the book were very much centered around\nthe relationship between sisters and a girl and her father,\nI still felt like I understood the emotion that was going on\nbetween them unlike in some other books with similar themes that\nI have read lately. The overall writing style was easy to read,\nperhaps too simplistic if you want to be an ass and comlain about\nsomething. Nonetheless, the writing did not feel juvenile nor\nforcibly convoluted, it just seemed correct for this story.</p>\n<p>There was a little bit of mystery in who was still alive\nin the future, and who was going to do what when, that made\nme want to keep going just to find out those answers. At the\nsame time, the story was enthralling enough to make me drop\nother activities to find out what was going to happen next.</p>\n<p>The last twenty to thirty pages are a real tear jerker. There\nare moments throughout the book that tug on the heart strings,\nbut the ending is sentimental and moving in a powerful and yet\ndid not come across as sappy. That being said, the ending\nfelt a bit rushed, which I felt was a literary device to avoid\nfully explaining some details of how the character's future\nwas really going to play out.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend this book. This is not what I would strictly\ncall literary fiction as none of the characters are strictly\nreal, but the general themes of what was going on during World War II\nseem to be roughly historicaly accurate. If you are a huge WWII buff,\nI can't promise this will live up to your standards. But, for everyone\nelse, this is a quality story set during a tumultous\ntime in the history of France. There is quite a bit of romance novel\nhere as well if that is your thing, although I would not really put\nthis into that genre as I think it is a bit limiting in terms of the\nreal breadth of the story. Nonetheless, I would not be surprised if\na movie adaptation of this book cuts out a fair amount of the other\nparts of the story and makes this into a more pure love story.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Nightingale","date":"28 Dec 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","history"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":435},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-12-28-the-nightingale.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-12-28-the-nightingale/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
