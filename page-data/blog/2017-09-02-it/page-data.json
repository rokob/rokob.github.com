The movie from 1990, which was\nactually a TV mini-series, was one of my favorite scary movies growing up.\nI figured the book would be alright, but somehow the visuals of a movie\nseemed to be more theoretically compelling. I was wrong. The book is by\nfar better than the original movie, and is great indepdently. I will have\nsomething to say about the new movie at the end.</p>\n<p>I put <em>It</em> on my reading list because I wanted to read it before the new\nmovie came out. The book is longer than anything else I have been reading\nlately, so it was a bit of a slog to get through. Nevertheless it was\nworth it. King's character development is thorough to the point of pedantic\nwhich I really like. The shear volume works because of his style. You get\ninvolved, want to know what is going to happen next, but still manage to\nlaugh.</p>\n<p>I was at a bit of an advantage having seen the 1990 movie before reading\nthe book because I knew the basic story arc. However, the book has so\nmany more plot twists and story lines. As with all movie adaptations,\nsome things need to be left out for the sake of time. The book is darker\nand more nuanced than any movie could probably be.</p>\n<p><em>It</em> is near the top of my list of books in the horror genre. I definitely\nthink it is worth the time and effort to read.</p>\n<p>Now, on the new movie. One of the worst things I have seen in quite some\ntime. Not <em>Jack Reacher: Never Go Back</em> bad. No this movie is bad in a much\nworse way. It changes fundamental parts of the story for no apparent reason,\nbut as a result loses all the meaning. The interplay between childhood\nand adulthood, between belief and doubt. Not just that, the movie itself\nis laughable. Moments that are intended to be scary come across as jokes.\nI went on a rant after coming home from this movie, but I don't feel like\nrecounting all of those problems here. Leave it to say, if you saw that movie,\ndo yourself a favor and read the book. If you haven't seen the movie,\ndo yourself a favor and don't.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"It","date":"03 Sep 2017","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","scifi"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":415},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2017-09-02-it.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017-09-02-it/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
