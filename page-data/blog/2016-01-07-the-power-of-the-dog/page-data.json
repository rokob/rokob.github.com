I finally got around\nto reading it, and man was it good.</p>\n<p>Not quite historical fiction, there is enough interplay with\nreality that really serves to drive this book forward. One would\nhave thought this book to be pure insanity back in the early 80s, I mean\nwould the US government ever really help foreign cocaine smugglers move\ndrugs and weapons between Colombia, Mexico, and the US? Pure nutjob, conspiracy\ntheory crap. Except this is essentially the cynical view of what the CIA\nreally did. Maybe it is not just the cynical view, maybe it is just the\nabbreviated view. In any event, this book is solidly written with\nwonderful lines, great characters which are developed thorougly, and has a delightful\ninterplay between different story lines, different locations, and different\npoints in time.</p>\n<p>I really like this style of writing. I am not sure if it even has a particular\nname. Don Winslow weaves some great lines throughout this book, such as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He half-expects to see blood in the bed -- his dreams are incarnadine;\nblood flows through them like a river, connecting one nightmare to another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He also has an extensive vocabulary. The more I read, the more I am fascinated\nby the existence of words that describe a situation or feeling or color\nperfectly, where any other synonym would be lacking in specificity and\ndepth. For instance, <code class=\"language-text\">menagerie</code> is a word I did not know existed before\nthis book. The dictionary defines it as \"a collection of wild animals kept in captivity for exhibition.\"\nAn alternative defintion is \"a strange or diverse collection of people or things.\"\nThe former definition fits exactly into a couple scenes in the book,\nand I was thinking if I was writing this how would I have described\na bunch of wild animals in kept in someones backyard in cages\nfor the purpose of showing them off? At the same time, the latter definition\nalso fits into describing the scene in a meta sense which gives even\nmore power to that single word. This is where I personally feel that\npeople involved in comparative literature and literary criticism can\ngo off the reservation by calling this usage brillant assuming the author\nhad both the surface intention as well as a deeper meta meaning intended\nby the use of this one word. Maybe he did.</p>\n<p>But, in another situation,\nhe used the exact same analogy, comparing oil rig pilot lights to\nsome kind of street light in hell or something, within twenty or thirty pages\nof one another. It felt like he wrote these two parts indepedently,\ncame up with this same analogy twice, and forgot that he had already\nused it. Then he merged those two parts together, and I was left\nfeeling like it was an amateur move. The first time I saw the analogy,\nas he actually wrote it, I felt it was awesome. Then when I come across\nit again, I felt like it was really cheap and lessened the prior use.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, overally this book was exactly in my preferred style.\nThe writing was descriptive and had a certain literary depth. The\ncharacters were relatable enough, but developed to the point of understanding\ntheir motivations even where they were not relatable. The entire plot\nwas not too outrageous given the actualy reality of the drug wars\nof the 1970s through 1990s. I highly recommend this, and I plan to\nread his other book relatively soon as well.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Power of the Dog","date":"07 Jan 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","fiction","great"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":620},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-01-07-the-power-of-the-dog.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-01-07-the-power-of-the-dog/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
