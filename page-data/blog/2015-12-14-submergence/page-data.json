I have\na feeling this came from one of those articles about adult vs young adult\nbooks and was listed as an adult book. It is very difficult to put\nthis book into a category. One of the descriptions on Amazon calls it\n\"postmodern literary airport fiction\" which is about as true as\nanything I could come up with.</p>\n<p>I found this book to be engaging and yet asking to be taken slowly.\nAlthough I wanted to see what was going to happen next, I realized\nI was dragging a bit just to take in what was going on. The style\nis unique insofar as comparing it to the last 50 or so books I have\nread. There is a certain arrogance to the writing style that\nput me off at times, but I overcame those feelings when I realized\nit was probably more a latent insecurity and thus not a fault of\nthe book.</p>\n<p>The title is cryptic and I could not really tell you in any\nsort of clarity what the book is about without giving too much\naway and yet probably not doing it justice. It is a love story,\nbut it is also a critique of modern society, even more a critique\nat times of humanity as a species. There are many meanings throughout\nthe book of submergence, so I would just say you have to read it\nand decide what you think it means.</p>\n<p>Overall, it is a short but dense novel. It can be boring at times\nas well as confusing mostly because of the multiple intertwined story\nlines at the lack of formal chapter based structure. There are\nminiature chapters that break up the different threads, but\nif you read it you will understand what I mean. At times I felt\nlike I would call this book great, but after finishing it, I\nthink it comes very close but I still have to throw it into\nthe merely good category. If anything, it is good and a half.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Submergence","date":"14 Dec 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","society"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":356},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-12-14-submergence.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-12-14-submergence/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
