I forgot why I added <a href=\"http://amzn.com/B0105VDUQ4\"><em>The Bell Jar</em></a> to my wishlist,\nbut it was sitting there when I went to buy another set of books so I figured\nwhy not give it a shot. I think I wanted to read something by Sylvia Plath\nas I have heard her name floated about but never really got around to it before.\nAs this is her only novel, it was a natural choice.</p>\n<p><em>The Bell Jar</em> is essentially autobiographical which makes it that much more\ninteresting to me, but even if it wasn't the story itself is quite good. The\nwriting is clearly on that higher level where you can tell the author really\ngets it. Her use of just the write metaphor at the right time made certain\nemotions come through in a distinct way. At the same time, it still comes\nacross as a first novel, raw and unpolished to a certain degree. The sad thing\nis that she succeeded in killing herself before writing another novel which\ncould have really allowed her to stretch her abilities.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend this book, although I will say it may be a tough read\nfrom an existential perspective. There are a lot of depressing scenes\nand themes that make you mentally have to work to distance yourself a bit\nlest you fall victim to the same bell jar that the title represents. That\ncould be just my opinion as my mind has a tendancy to run wild when presented\nwith pessimistic, depressing styles of writing. I'm not naturally pessimistic\nor depressed, but it just gets my mind going down strange rabbit holes.\nMoreover, I do not think you have to be depressive to have a reaction to\nthis book. It has a subtle way of pulling you in even if you try to distance\nyourself from the main character.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Bell Jar","date":"29 Feb 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","life"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":323},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-02-29-the-bell-jar.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-02-29-the-bell-jar/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
