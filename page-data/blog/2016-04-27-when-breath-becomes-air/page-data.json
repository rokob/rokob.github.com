I do not think\nI read that article, only a snippet about the book. Basically, guy is a\ndoctor, finds out he has cancer, decides to write book while he is dying,\nnow he is dead, here is the book.</p>\n<p>I was not sure what this book was going to be about going into it\nand now I can say it was mostly a reflection on life, death, their\ninterplay, and meaning in general. There was a feeling similar to\n<em>Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintainence</em> at times which I found\nto be quite interesting. One thing he said which really struck me was</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>direct experience of life-and-death questions was essential to\ngenerating substantial moral opinions about them</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, if you sit in academia and think about moral philosophy,\nyou are not really authoritative on the subject because you are living\ntoo far removed from death. You lack moral action by restricting yourself\nto the realm of words. Only from the edge can you really start to understand\nmorality. For the author, this was why he went to medical school and became\na surgeon, he believed that he was better able to understand meaning in life\nby being on the frontline of life-and-death decisions.</p>\n<p>My main problem with this book, common among surgeons, is their overwhelming\nsense of self importance. He literally says that it was his job to choose\nwho gets to live and die and that responsiblity was important to him. Now\nthat is genuinely factual. A trama surgeon can make decisons during operations\nor not to operate at all that lead to certain outcomes based on what they think\nis best for someone. Sometimes the doctor thinks that death is preferable to\na diminished life or a vegetative state. But, he comes across as if he is\nsomehow more important because he decided to go to a trade school that results\nin that type of day to day. Just like I do not think all soldiers, policemen,\nfire fighters, are heros, not all surgeons instruments of divine intervention.\nYou go through life making decisions, one of those is how you spend your time\nand how you choose to support yourself. One can choose to become a doctor just\nas one can choose to be a carpenter. As a doctor you choose to help people in\na certain way, if that is for you then great, but you should not think of\nyourself as morally superior because you decided on that career.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the book itself is quite well written and offers a fair amount\nof insight into the mind of the terminally ill. It is strange that people\ntend to only think about life only when concerned with their ultimate demise,\nas the author points out</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fact of death is unsettling. Yet there is no other way to live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You here people trying to get the most out of life only when they realize\nthey do not have much time left. Notions such as \"bucket lists\" become the\nway that people try to internalize the fact that they are going to die,\nwill not have enough time to do everything they want, but do not really want\nto fully grasp that concept. If they just make a list then they can try to\ndo some of those things and not really contemplate death. But if you really\nface death, you will realize that all those things you think are part of\neveryday life that are important maybe are not so.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most ambitions are either achieved or abandoned, either way, they belong to the past.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You have ideas of what your life to be, you work towards these goals delaying\ngratification you think will come when you finally achieve your ambition. But then\nyou get there and realize you did not really enjoy the journey, you do not know\nwhat to do next other than make a new goal and try to get their. That next one\nwill make you happy. Then you realize you actually are going to die, even though\nsubconsciously you hoped you would somehow be spared or that it was so far away\nthat it did not matter. You start to realize that if you keep going on this way,\nyou will constantly be living in the past and future until one day your present\nno longer exists because you are dead. You struggle against that by blinding\nyourself to the possibility. Most people cannot comprehend this nothingness\nthat awaits us all until it is too late. They try to ignore death by pawning off\nmoral and philosophical questions either to religion or ignorance.</p>\n<p>Some people choose life. They choose life by accepting death. Face death not\nas an enemy but as a guide on the journey you have. What makes life worth living?\nWhy do you not kill yourself and get it over with? Can you honestly look yourself\nin the mirror and have a good answer for that? A lot of people think they can,\nonly because they lie to themselves so much they cannot tell the difference.\nThis book explores a lot of these themes and will help give you some perspective\non the human condition.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"When Breath Becomes Air","date":"27 Apr 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","life","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":3,"wordCount":{"words":896},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-04-27-when-breath-becomes-air.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-04-27-when-breath-becomes-air/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
