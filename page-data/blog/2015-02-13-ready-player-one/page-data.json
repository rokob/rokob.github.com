I love sci-fi books even though they are always\ndystopian. <em>Ready Player One</em> did not disappoint, it was a page turner that\nkept me on the edge throughout.</p>\n<p>I just realized it when I wrote it above, but all books about the future\nseem to graviate towards the theme of something being build to make life\nbetter which ultimately makes life worse. Usually it is some sort of\ntechnology that leads the characters to the conclusion that the good ol'\ndays or the old fashioned way of doing this is actually the best. I would\nreally like to read a book about where we either don't progress that much\nand thus the future is not too different than today, or where we build\nsomething that just makes things better. Why not have conflict center\naround some other aspect of life, but just happen to take place in a\nfuture where cool shit makes life better and different? I have yet\nto come across such a book, but hopefully one day. This book is dystopian\nin that people escape reality into a virtual world to the point where\nthe world is falling apart around them and this just drives them further\ninto their obsession with the simulation.</p>\n<p>I think the type of world that is described in this book is not too far\nfrom the reality of the possible in the next few years. We are already\ngetting much better at VR, and based on the trends of computing innovations,\nI would not be surprised to see something like what is described in this\nbook existing, at least from a technical point of view. Now whether it is\nadopted at the scale as presented in this book, or if it has the secondary\nconsequences on reality that are preesnt here is a different question. One\ncould argue that we are already evolving into a world that is more disconnected\nfrom reality. I think my perspective on that is skewed based on where I live\nand work, because that does not seem to be the case in many other parts of the US.\nBut, nonetheless, this book make me think a little bit about the ramifications\nof disconnecting from reality, both positively and negatively.</p>\n<p>I definitely recommend this book to anyone of roughly my generation who\nlikes video games and eighties movies. I think it would be good for anyone,\nbut if you hate video games you might find it boring or hard to relate\nto the abundance of references.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ready Player One","date":"13 Feb 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","scifi"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":464},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-02-13-ready-player-one.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-02-13-ready-player-one/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
