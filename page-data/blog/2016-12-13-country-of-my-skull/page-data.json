I had never\nheard about the Truth and Reconciliation Committee (TRC) or maybe I had but did not remember the\ndetails well enough. We went to the Apartheid museum in Johannesburg and I made an offhand remark\nwhile watching one of the video clips that I found this TRC thing to be interesting. Taya was\nshocked at my lack of knowledge about it and thus recommended I read <em>Country of My Skull</em> as a good\noverview of both the TRC as well as to fill in more details about the fall of Apartheid.</p>\n<p>It was fascinating in relation to other moments in history when regimes changed either through\nexternal wars such as Nazi Germany, revolution such as in America, Russia, and France, or through\ncivil revolt against authoratative regimes such as in Chile and South Africa. The SA version of\nregime change was unique as well as the regimes themselves. Thus the process involving the TRC was\nnecessarily special.</p>\n<p>Apartheid is fascinating in its approach to institutionalized racism. The system in the US always\nseems to have an air of trying to hide the racism behind other concepts and getting discrimination\nin through the backdoor. This was not always the case, in particular if one looks at the Jim Crow\nlaws, however at least since the mid 1960s the racism has been more subtle. In SA they put it all\nout there and codified what it meant to be white, coloured, or black. You got an ID book which said\nwhat race you were and therefore defined what you could and could not do. This continued until the\n1990s. The regime change took a long civil war which was both ethnic and racial. It stratified on\nrace, gender, economic class, and historical lineage. Calling it just a race war is actually too\nsimplifying.</p>\n<p>The book is quite a good companion to teh rest of the history by focusing on the entire TRC process\nfrom ideation to aftermath. As I said, being in South Africa while reading it gave the book a bit\nmore of an interesting flavour. I highly recommend reading it especially if you do not know that\nmuch about Apartheid and the TRC.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Country of My Skull","date":"13 Dec 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","death","great","history","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":379},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-12-13-country-of-my-skull.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-12-13-country-of-my-skull/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
