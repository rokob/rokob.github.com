I found it difficult to\nput down, even more so that some of the other books that I have\nbeen reading recently. From someone who is somewhat technically\ninclined, the science seemed legit, at least to the point where\nI found no trouble accepting the narrative. Combine the decent science\nwith the fact that the story was unique and humorous, and I have\nto say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and I would\nhighly recommend it.</p>\n<p><em>The Martian</em> is a bit of futuristic Robinson Crusoe set on Mars.\nThere are twists and turns, with the majority of the narative\ntold in the first person by a man alone on planet Mars. This is\na cool setting with a lot of potential, and although the writing\ndidn't blow me away, it was sufficient to weave a compelling\ntale.</p>\n<p>I have a feeling this will be turned in to a movie, and I believe\nthat the movie will be pretty good. There were quite a few\nmoments of comic relief that made the book really stand out. Too often\nsci-fi can come across as overly serious to try and make itself\nmore than it is. This book doesn't take itself too seriously,\nwhich I think makes the moments of tension more believeable and easier\nto swallow, because otherwise you wouldn't be sure when you\ncan relax. There are a few surprises which keep things interesting,\nand seeing as it is a book, you kinda expect it to only end in\none possible way, but the journey is still a roller coaster.</p>\n<p>Reading this made me remember how much I enjoy sci-fi and\nthe concept of space travel in general. I think I will have to\nincorporate more sci-fi on to my reading list of the coming\nmonths. I really like this idea of reading whatever I find\ninteresting rather than what I deem to be necessary. Each book\nI read helps me to better understand what I like to read, which\nfurther refines my future reading list. The feedback cycle is\npretty good. I am surprised one of my random picks has not been\n\"bad\" besides the one I read because I thought I had to.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Martian","date":"26 Jan 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","scifi","good"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":383},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-01-26-the-martian.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-01-26-the-martian/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
