I know people who\nare married who have known their spouse for significantly less time than we were\ntogether. So this is somewhere on the spectrum between a breakup and a divorce.\nWe have gone through most of our formative years\nas a pair, gone through a lot of life experiences which will forever be tied up\nwith us. Graduating college, graduate school, our first jobs, moving more than 10\ntimes, traveling in Europe and the US, etc. I don't really know what this post\nis going to be as I am writing this, I am not really sure what I want it to be.\nI just want to get my thoughts down sometime close to the moment but far enough\naway to have some limited perspective.</p>\n<p>The short story is that I am emotionally disconnected and therefore not providing\nenough of a \"connection\" as what is desired. This is something her and I have discussed\nin the past, even to the point of discussing whether our relationship was viable\nin the long term, but had also moved past it. This time she said that after thinking\nabout it for a while that she thinks the best thing for both of us is to just be friends.\nI agreed with that sentiment. I think that if something is missing which makes her\nunhappy or that she is going to continually be looking for, then I don't want to be\na part of that unsatisfying relationship. Personally, I thought everything was\nbasically fine, but that is part of the problem I guess.</p>\n<p>I don't really have much more to say about this that I want to write down. I guess\nthere will be more things that come up over time, but for now it's over and\nwho knows where we'll go from here.</p>\n<p>On a separate note, we have moved to separate places, I am living in San Francisco\nagain which has been an interesting experience. I think that is going to be the\nbiggest source of adjustment for me as time goes on. We split up and stayed living\ntogether for a few weeks which made it seem like nothing was different. Now that\nI am living on my own again, it will take same time, but things are starting to\nactually seem more real.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"End of an era","date":"19 Dec 2014","categories":"life","tags":["life","moving","relationships"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":413},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2014-12-19-end-of-an-era.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2014-12-19-end-of-an-era/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
