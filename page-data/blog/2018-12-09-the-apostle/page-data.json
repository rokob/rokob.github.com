Not much to say\nabout this one, it was about on par with the other books in the series. Scot is no longer\nworking for the government, but the same shenangians as usual go on. Not the peak of literary\ngreatness nor realism, but a fun, quick read nonetheless.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Apostle","date":"09 Dec 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":62},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-12-09-the-apostle.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-12-09-the-apostle/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
