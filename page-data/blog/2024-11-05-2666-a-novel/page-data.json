I think it was quite good but it took me forever to read and\nit was one of the most unique things I have ever read. It was all over the place at times and one\nlarge part felt like it was complete batshit at times as it kept going on. The descriptions of\nkillings started to feel fake in their quantity but alas I know they are not. Even though this is\nfiction that part is based at least partially on reality.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend this, but make sure you are ready to commit to a long and complicated novel.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"2666: A Novel","date":"05 Nov 2024","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","crime"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":106},"fields":{"sha":"68777d79b2dc22b108d2de7a3168272d68a75f53"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2024-11-05-2666-a-novel.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2024-11-05-2666-a-novel/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
