I read\n<a href=\"https://amzn.com/B000FC147G\"><em>The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying</em></a> because the <em>Tibetan Book of the Dead</em> was\nalways on my list of books to read. However, after reading about reading that, I found the\nrecommendation for an outsider to read the former book as it is much more approachable and useful\nthan the latter. I am glad I made this choice because even this book was a bit unuseful at times\nbecause of constantly refering to the need to speak to a mentor about the ideas.</p>\n<p>Death is an intersting topic. I actually feel like I need to sit down and write more about this on\nhere rather than in my private files, but for now I am going to stay at a higher level rather than\nreally getting too deep. The Tibetan view on life and death is so specific and regimented that one\nstarts to feel like maybe they do know something that the rest of us do not. For instance, the\nnumber of days spent in a certain state between life and death and what goes on there seems like\nsomething knowable only by the dead. However, the concept of cyclical life and death is very\nintriguing to me. The issue for everyone if they think hard enough usually is \"yeah but what came\nbefore that\" when you keep moving back in time when thinking about the universe. Roger Penrose was\nthe first one to introduce me to the idea of a cyclical universe. That is, the current state of\nexpansion that we observe is just one small part in the cosmic cycle of continual expansion and\ncontraction. \"The\" big bang was just one of an infinite number of singularities in a chain of\ncreation of and destructions. This is somehow comforting because it satisfies the curiosity of what\ncame before the big bang, a big crunch. Translated to the human condition, death is just the\nbeginning of the next birth.</p>\n<p>Is this easy to accept and structure your life around? Clearly no. Even more so, Western culture\nmakes a mockery of this idea. I make a mockery of this idea. Afterlife? You must be insane. But, if\nyou sit down and really try to accept the fact that you are going to die, and really feel what it\nwill feel like when you are taking your last breaths, you start to question a lot of things. Why not\nat least consider the possibility? You can rule it out by whatever mechanism you use for decision\nmaking or that you believe in, but you should not dismiss the notion simply because it is foreign to\nyou. This book presented ideas to me that I knew of vaguely, but for which I did not have a strong\nunderstanding. I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand how some Eastern cultures view the\nprocess of life and how they cope with pain and death. I feel I am better off for at least\nconsidering these ideas, shaping my own ideas and logic with more information always leads me to a\nbetter place even if it is a harder road.</p>\n<p>All that said, there is a lot in this book about the practices one should employ while alive, dying,\nand dead to acheive enlightenment. If you are not planning on putting these in to practice, then a\ngood chunk of the information in this book is extraneous. You will find yourself getting bored\nreading about exactly how to mediate on a certain idea. I was more interested in the philosophical\ncomponents and therefore found myself bored with a fair amount of the book. However, it is good to\nknow where to go if I ever decide to pursue this line of thought further.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying","date":"19 Sep 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","life","nonfiction","death"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":635},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-09-19-the-tibetan-book-of-living-and-dying.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-09-19-the-tibetan-book-of-living-and-dying/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
