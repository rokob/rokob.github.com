Like many popular science books, it is repetitive\nand could probably get away with half as many pages. But, I don't think publishers would take a\nbook that short because people don't take very short books seriously. So you fluff out to 200\npages. However, the overall message is good and it is an easy read.</p>\n<p>I definitely recommend\nthis if you are doing the rounds of parenting books. I waited until now to read it because I knew\nit would be less relevant for a very small child. Even still I probably got in a bit early as most\nof the material is more suitable for older children.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Whole-Brain Child","date":"08 Mar 2020","categories":"book","tags":["book","nonfiction","okay","parenting"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":127},"fields":{"sha":"f958402637ea69fe9d6042157b47f7b79488850d"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2020-03-08-the-whole-brain-child.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2020-03-08-the-whole-brain-child/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
