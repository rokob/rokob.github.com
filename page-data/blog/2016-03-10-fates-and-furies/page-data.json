This is a heavy book with a wide variety of twists\nand turns and themes relating to belonging and loneliness. I definitely\nrecommend it, but it drags on at times in a flurry of pretense.</p>\n<p>I had an idea for a book that I thought would be interesting. Tell the story\nof a relationship between two people in two books, one from each perspective.\nI thought the retelling of the same events from the two sides would be\nfascinating. Turns out that this book is essentially just that, although\nnot quite exactly how I intended. It is more about two different ways of viewing\nthe world in general which just happens to be embodied by a husband and wife.</p>\n<p>My main problems with this book revolved around my revulsion of most of the\ncharacters as well as the overuse of descriptive language. I hated all\nof the characters at one point or another. They were either unbelievable,\nannoying, or just plain bad. They had their moments, and as a whole, they\nfit together, but I still found it hard at times to read because I did\nnot feel for them. The other big issue relating to the literary style of\nthe book is common among literary fiction. There is a fine line between\ncompelling metaphor and an ostentatious display. Now the big issue with\ncomplaining about this is that depending on your vocabulary you will complain\nabout such issues sooner or later. One who has no depth to their vocabulary will\noften complain sooner that a book is being to showy, trying to overuse the\nthesaurus. On the other hand, one with an extensive vocabulary will usually\nonly complain if the words are used incorrectly or if the writing feels off,\nbut they will nonetheless complain less about the use of language. My vocabulary\nis somewhere in the middle, I look up a lot of words while I am reading.\nI still feel that a fair amount of this book was extraneous, meant only\nto show off or lengthen the novel for some reason. There was some great\nimagery, and some great phrasing, but in the end I was annoyed a little too\noften and it took away from my enjoyment.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fates and Furies","date":"10 Mar 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","relationships"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":390},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-03-10-fates-and-furies.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-03-10-fates-and-furies/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
