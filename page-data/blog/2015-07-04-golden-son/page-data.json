Hence, I didn't\nfeel compelled to get around to <em>Golden Son</em> very quickly.\nI am glad that I did eventually get to it as it was a pretty\ngood book.</p>\n<p>My notion of what constitutes a good book varies based on\nmy expectations going in as well as the genre. I did not expect\nan epic masterpiece when I read the first book in this series,\nI was entertained but clearly it was never going to be some\nmonumental piece of literature. Thus, the second book, while\nI say it was good, was good in the same way as the first. It\nwas an entertaining and easy read. There were enough twists and\nturns to keep me guessing and interested. I know I enjoy\nwhat I am reading when I tell myself just one more chapter, and\nthen I have to read two or three more because I need to know\nwhat is going to happen next.</p>\n<p>Unlike the first book, this book ended with quite the cliffhanger.\nI will have to read the final book and pretty soon as I am curious\nto find out what will happen next. There were some obvious twists,\nbut for the most part, the author kept me guessing where he was\ngoing to take the narrative next. I wonder if they will make these\ninto movies, I have trouble seeing them done well because of the\nwide variety of overly large and exotic things that are described.\nFor example, there are space battles and people of very different\nsizes and descriptions that all would require a fair amout of CGI.\nIt could be done, but I fear if they do make these into movies they\nwill probably end up looking like shit not to mention having a great\ndeal of the story cut out because the entire books would be five hour\nmovies each.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Golden Son","date":"04 Jul 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":361},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-07-04-golden-son.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-07-04-golden-son/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
