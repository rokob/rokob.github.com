When I was working at\nFacebook, I had metacognitive moments sitting in meetings\nwhere people were discussing things like the text on an\nalert telling people about their privacy settings, or\nwhere people had trouble resetting their password, where\nI just could not believe this was real life. Like these\npeople were being 100% serious about things that seemed\nso absolutely ridiculous and trivial to me. But then I\nhad to remember that I had these feelings before and that\nit was just the way that I viewed the world.</p>\n<p>I have an inability to \"take things seriously.\" By that, I\nmean that whenever I am in a situation where others view\nsomething as important, I am usually confused because I just\ndon't see what the big deal is either way. There hasn't\nbeen anything in the past ten years or more where I've\nhad feelings like I have to be serious or something good\nwon't happen or something bad will. Someone died? I am\nmuch more likely to just make a joke than say something\nsympathetic, not because I'm a dick or I am covering up\nsomething, but because I don't think anything is really\nthat important.</p>\n<p>We live, things happen, you have to enjoy what you enjoy\nwhile you can, but you can't take anything too seriously.\nThis point hit home for me really hard, when I watched a\nshow on HBO called \"Planet Twelve: The Secret Life of 12-Year-Olds\"\nwhich is basically just following 6th graders around for\na week asking them questions about what is important\nand difficult or good about their lives. It was eye-opening\nbecause I remember being that age, and I remember feeling\nand hearing some of the same things these kids talked\nabout it. I remember thinking that something was so important\nthat if it didn't go one way then my life was just going\nbe over. But when you hear the same things coming out of a\n12 year olds mouth when you are 20, you realize how stupid\nit sounds. How meaningless their \"problems\" are. But, I think\nmost people take this and turn it into, \"oh geez, these kids\ndon't know what real problems are like the one's I have, when\nthey grow up they will realize how stupid those problems were\nwhen they've got real adult problems to deal with.\" I have talked\nto other people about this concept and that is usually\nthe gist of their reaction. My reaction was quite different.\nRather than making the same mistake as those 12 year olds, just\nwith larger problems, I took a step back and thought, maybe\nnothing we think is important today really is. What if,\nwe realize in the moment, than in 5 years we will think\nthat the most important thing today is actually pretty\nmeaningless. Whatever it is, our future self will have resolved\nit and we won't really see a direct link from that decision\nto whatever is the next important thing at that point in\nthe future. Realizing that in the moment, we can then\nhave a larger view of the present that isn't overly\nconcerned with the mundane or even the exceptional.\nClearly there are some things that can be so life changing\nthat they are \"important\", for instance if you\nare paralyzed or get a life sentence in prison. But I\nwould argue that even those things, as long as you are\nstill alive, after 5 years or so, you will have settled\nin to a new routine and life will just go on for you.</p>\n<p>With that context on why I don't take things serious,\nI have to say that people in Silicon Valley have their\nhead's so far up their asses that what they think is\nimportant, I don't think most people elsewhere in the\nworld would find important, but I definitely do not.\nI hear people talking about how they believe they are\nchanging the world because they are creating an iPhone\napp that lets you do, I stop listening at this point.\nThey pitch their companies with such highfalutin language\nand attitude that I just want to vomit. Is Uber changing\nthe world? Are people's lives meaningfully different?\nI would say technically the answer to the first\nquestion is yes because the world is constantly changing,\nand there must be some people whose lives are very\ndifferent now, but does it matter? I am disillusioned\nby the concepts that people are getting off on.\nI just don't get how people can wake up every day\nand do what they do with a straight face. This is\nnot unique to tech or the Valley, but it is where\nI currently live, where I work, and I think it is a\nmagnified here more than other places and industries.</p>\n<p>I left Facebook for lots of reasons, but one that I\ndon't think I fully internalized at the time was what\nI am talking about here. I didn't realize how large\nthis was and how much I didn't get it. I thought that\nleaving a social network to go to a company that\nwas doing something real was the solution to my\nphilosophical ruminations, but I now realize that is\nnot the solution. My actual problems were deeper seeded,\nI feel how unimportant things are, and even more\nhow ridiculous it is that I can live my life just\nwriting basically straight forward code. I actually\ncan't even find the words right now to say what\nI really mean. There is just a ludicrousness to it\nall that is eating away at me.</p>\n<p>All of this has led me to think about other things\nthat I have always wanted to do, or what type of day\nto day would be less absurd to me. It is hard to\nsay exactly what would not be absurd because it often\ncomes down just down to perspective. But, there is\none thing that I am seriously considering, which I alluded\nto in one of my previous posts about a book that I\nrecently read. Nothing is going to change yet,\nbut I am thinking and we will see what happens.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Silicon Wasteland","date":"07 Jan 2015","categories":"life","tags":["life","work","society","musings"]},"timeToRead":4,"wordCount":{"words":1044},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-01-07-silicon-wasteland.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-01-07-silicon-wasteland/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
