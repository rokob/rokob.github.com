I am\nreally glad that I decided to read it, because to be frank, the subject matter\ndid not jump out at me as all that interesting. All I could tell from the title\nwas that this was a book about a kid from the ghetto who went to the \"Ivy League\"\nand eventually dies. I knew nothing of how the story would actually unfold, nor\nhow captivating the book would turn out to be.</p>\n<p>I can't understand the situation that Robert Peace grew up in nor his\nstate of mind when he made certain life decisions. It is fundamentally not\npossible to grasp certain details that go along with having the grow up\nin a bad neighborhood or have a father in prison for murder, for someone\nwho grew up in an upper middle class suburb with very little familial strife.\nIt is one of those situations, where the only thing to get as that you really\ndon't get it and you never will. That being said, there was a lot of information\nin this book that helped bridge some of the gap in my understanding. More than\nanything, I was presented with information that I had never considered\nbefore or heard explained in a way that actually got through to me. One of these\nthings had to do with the transition to a top tier, predominately white university\nfor someone who grew up as Robert Peace did.</p>\n<p>As was explained in the book, Newark, like many other urban centers, had experienced\nthe so-called white flight before Rob Peace was born. This led to him growing up\nin a place where he was in the majority. I guess I never thought about it because there\nis an emphasis on white people as the majority overall, but this is only in the aggregate.\nMost locations are not as diverse as the aggregate statistics would lead us to believe,\neven though they are not all that diverse to begin with. Most places are dominated by\na small number of ethnic groups, such that there is almost always a clear overwhelming\nmajority. For example, where I grew up, the overwhelming majority of the population\nwas white, followed by Asian, and then everyone else rounded out the long tail. I knew\nkids of all races, but honestly only a handful were not white. Rob Peace grew up in the\nsame kind of neighborhood, only the majority was black, with maybe a handful of Latinos\nand white kids. Clearly our neighborhoods were nothing alike, but we both grew up in\nthe majority within where we lived. However, when I went to college that didn't change.\nWhen Rob Peace went to college, he had to experience the reality of being in the minority\nfor the first time.</p>\n<p>That is not fair to say because most of the situation in Newark could be attributed to\nRob being in the minority among the surrounding neighborhoods, but within his own\narea of East Orange, he could look around and be in the majority. This is one of the aspects\nthat I suspect (and the author seemed to as well) made the transition to college for\n\"under privileged\" students extra hard. It is really the first time in many people's lives\nwhere they really feel the weight of minority/majority groups in their every day lives.\nWell at least that is probably true for the white kids. I suspect that most of the\nminority students get racism much more acutely than the liberal white kids trying to\nchange something they don't really get in the first place.</p>\n<p>I found it hard not to have many of the same feelings of the people around Rob about\nthe decisions he made after Yale. It is so easy for me or anyone to view someone else's\nlife, especially in hindsight, and know exactly why something was a bad decision. But\nclearly there was a lot more going on that I just can't even begin to fathom. Mainly this\nrevolves around his decisions that seem crazy to me that he made in order to support those\naround him. He was dealing drugs for a lot of reasons, but I think the primary motivation\nwas to be a provider, to be a man, to be depended upon. This is a difficult ideology for\nme to grasp, at least emotionally, but I get the sentiment. I get that one could feel\nthis way and because of that they would make rash decisions. I understand the idea of\nwanting to protect certain aspects of life around you, especially when it relates to\nthings you find important. However, I have never really felt that way personally about\nindividual people per se. I think most people have a duty to provide for themselves\non a day to day basis. I can understand helping someone out how and when you can, but\nI don't get sacrificing yourself to enable those around you who haven't cared for\nthemselves. I do get going to war to protect the country as a whole which makes\nmuch more sense to me as that is not related to one or a few individuals. It is more\nphilosophical than that.</p>\n<p>Overall, I recommend reading this book. I think it is eye opening no matter what\nyour background or point of view. I am sure some people would read it and see\nsome kid who fell into the trap of easy money and got what comes to many who\ntake that risk. I am sure others would read this and take it as an example of how\nthe blight of poverty can be so all encompassing that it is nearly impossible to\nescape no matter how intelligent or educated one is. Personally, I saw a confused\nkid, not altogether different from myself, who made a few good choices and a few\nbad choices. Someone who had some bad shit in his life, who had a different morality\nand set of values, but at the end of the day, someone who was just trying to figure\nhimself out. Bad shit happens to good people, bad shit happens to bad people, shit\nhappens to everyone, sometimes it's the bed we make and sometimes it's dumb luck.\nI think this is a raw story that speaks more in how normal it all seemed to me. I\ntook most of the story in stride, a simple recounting of facts, with a pretty\nclear path of decisions that were sometimes strange, but never outrageous when\ntaken in context. I did want to reach through the pages and slap some sense\ninto him every once and a while, but it was clear that this would never have\nworked on Robert Peace and I understand that mentality just as well too.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace","date":"02 Mar 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","nonfiction","society"]},"timeToRead":4,"wordCount":{"words":1154},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-03-02-the-short-and-tragic-life-of-robert-peace.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-03-02-the-short-and-tragic-life-of-robert-peace/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
