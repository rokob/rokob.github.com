This book centers around the concept\nof the birthrate of girls dropping to zero rather than all births, but\nthat would be a byproduct eventually.</p>\n<p>The character development of this book is what really turned me off. I had\ntrouble at times remembering who certain characters were or why I should\neven care about them. There were groups of people introduced at the same\ntime with a few sentences of explanation that made them seem like\nsuperfluous additions.</p>\n<p>Apparently this is the first book in a series, but I do not plan on\nreading any of the others. If you are really bored and like young, female\nprotagonists then maybe you should pick this up, otherwise move along.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Last Girl","date":"11 May 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","okay","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":180},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-05-11-the-last-girl.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-05-11-the-last-girl/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
