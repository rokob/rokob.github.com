As I have found before,\nit is much easier for me to stay interested and plow through a book that\nI am really interested in. Roughneck Nine-One is about one particular\nengagement of a special forces ODA during the beginning of the most recent\nIraq war. There is also some good color associated with their workup\nas well as their analysis after the fact.</p>\n<p>Special forces are an interesting group in that most of what you can read\nabout in the press or in books are atypical of their normal modus operandi\nas they typically operate covertly. This book is thus only one side of what\ntype of action an A-team gets itself into. The fact that there were reporters\non the battlefield made this story easier to sell to the Army that it should\nbe told. I found the book to be an quick and interesting read. The writing could\nhave been a little better, but it was definitly functional.</p>\n<p>I would not characterize this book as great, but it is clearly a good book in\nthe military genre. There are many books written about situations that arose\nin Iraq and Afghanistan post 9/11, and this is a great entry in that list as\nit is written by someone on the ground about a very particular engagement that\nhe was directly involved in.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Roughneck Nine-One","date":"10 May 2015","categories":"book","tags":["good","military","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":263},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-05-10-roughneck-nine-one.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-05-10-roughneck-nine-one/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
