I picked it up and glanced at the back cover, decided\nthat yes I would like to read this but based on it's heft not on\nthis trip. My Kindle has been the sole source of my reading for\nquite a while now, so picking up a random book to lug around on\na trip just didn't make sense. I added it to my wishlist and I finally\ngot around to finishing it now. It took me three weeks to work through\nboth because it has heavy prose as well as my preoccupation with\nother endevors.</p>\n<p>Within the first 10% of the book I knew this was going to be something\nI would enjoy. The style is exactly the kind that I have found myself\nenjoying. This is truly a great book. That being said, there were\nplenty of times where I got overly annoyed with the main character for\nbeing such a little bitch. Not only that, the philisophical theme\nthat this ends on is nihilistic to the point of despression. Much\nof the emotional response that I had throughout the book was not\nwhat I would call happy or good, but nevertheless it was a captivating\nread and one that made me think and feel.</p>\n<p>To be honest, the longer the book, the harder it is to write these\nreviews or whatever they are. There is so much that I could talk about,\ndifferent thoughts I had during different parts, characters that I did\nand did not identify with, but it seems unfitting to just talk about\nsome of it and not all, and therefore I feel it better to just not\nsay much. I highly recommend this book, it is worth the length\nif you are a fan of stylistic fiction. I certainly felt like this\ncould have easily lived in another time period rather than being\nwritten in the past few years. That is, a lot of modern literature\nsucks, this is more inline with what I would expect out of classical\nliterature.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Goldfinch","date":"23 Feb 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","life"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":350},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-02-23-the-goldfinch.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-02-23-the-goldfinch/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
