This book\npresents a theory for how to have a successful direct action\nmission with a special operation force and uses eight case studies\nstarting with World War II to demonstrate these principles.</p>\n<p>There are many interesting stories in the history of warfare,\nsome of these I knew the basic details and others were new to me.\nThe theory that is presented makes a lot of sense with a few\nsimple principles that are essential to success. The first\ninsight is that although a small attacking force is usually\nalways considered to be inferior to a large defensive force,\nit is possible for the small force to temporarily achieve\nrelative superiority. The six principles of special operations\nthat allow the force to achieve and sustain relative superiority\nlong enough to be victorious are: simplicity, security, repetition,\nsurprise, speed, and purpose.</p>\n<p>The eight cases studies were mostly successful, some more so than\nthe others. I think what would have made the book better would be\nto analyze some missions that are generally considered to be failures.\nThe SF raid on Son Tay to rescue POWs in Vietnam is\nanalyzed in this book. It might be considered by some to be a failure\nboth politically and because no POWs were rescued. However, the mission\nwas definitely a success in terms of getting in and getting out\nwithout a loss of life by a small attacking force against a much\nlarger defensive force. The intelligence was a failure, but the mission\nitself was a success. The only one I can think of off the top of my\nhead is the attempt by Delta to raid the embassy\nin Tehran, but they never even got close to beginning their assault\ndue to crashing in the desert.</p>\n<p>This is a good piece of history with a solid theory that is backed up\nby some compelling historic analysis. It would be nice if the author\nlater did a write up of the Osama bin Laden raid which he was part\nof in terms of strategy.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Spec Ops","date":"01 Jul 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","great","history","military","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":357},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-07-01-spec-ops.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-07-01-spec-ops/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
