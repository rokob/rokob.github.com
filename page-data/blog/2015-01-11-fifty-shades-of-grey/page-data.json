Therefore,\nI decided to read <a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/dp/0345803485\"><em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em></a> just\nto figure out what the deal is.</p>\n<p>First, I would not really say that I recommend this book. The writing\nis not very good. There are many things that are unrealistic and\na bit exaggerated that it was difficult to read at times. Now,\nthese were not things related to the sex scenes, the unrealistic\nparts were mostly related to the internal dialogue of the main\ncharacter. No one blushes as much as this girl claims to.</p>\n<p>The book was written by a woman, from a woman's perspective,\nand clearly the intended audience is women. Someone can\nobviously write a book as a woman, from a woman's perspective,\nbut for a gender neutral audience. Certain aspects of this book\nwere more difficult for me to really get in to because I am\nmale. So I can't really say how this book reads from a female\nperspective.</p>\n<p>All in all, this book was actually okay. It had interesting\nthemes which are rarely discussed in main stream literature.\nThe writing, while terrible overall, actually got a bit\nbetter as the book went on. In fact, I think the last chapter\nwas probably the best in the book which left me with a better\nimpression than I had through the first half of the book.</p>\n<p>I do not plan to read the other two books in the series.\nThis just wasn't really my type of book, and I do not think\nI would get much enjoyment out of the other two. However,\nI would be lying if I said I was not curious to find out\nwhat happens next because this book ends in something of\na cliff hanger.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fifty Shades of Grey","date":"11 Jan 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","sex","okay"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":323},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-01-11-fifty-shades-of-grey.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-01-11-fifty-shades-of-grey/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
