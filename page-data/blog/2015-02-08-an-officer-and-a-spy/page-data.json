The first example of this that\nI remember reading was <a href=\"http://amzn.com/0451171357\"><em>The Agony and the Ecstasy</em></a>. That was\na very good book which introduced me to the idea of creatively filling\nin the gaps between what is known and what is not.\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EBRU05I\"><em>An Officer and a Spy</em></a> is a novel that revolves\naround the true events during the late 19th century in France\nknown as the Dreyfus affair.</p>\n<p>I knew nothing of this scandal before reading the book which I\nthink was good for keeping me engaged and excited to find out\nwhat would happen next. That being said, the read was laborious\nat times with quite a few parts that were just downright boring.\nOverall it was well constructed around the truth, but was probably\nabout 20% longer than it needed to be.</p>\n<p>My main motivation for reading is to discover new things about\nmyself and/or to spur new thoughts and insights. I try to find\nat least one provocative thought to come out of the books I\nread. This book made me viscerally angry at times by the way it\nseemed certain people were getting away with blatant deceit. I\nwas angry with the way a good man was being destroyed for doing\nthe right thing. I have a strong sense of morality and I am\npained to see the rewards of immorality even in a book. That\nsounds a light more high and mighty than the reality of it but\nit is hard to describe any other way.</p>\n<p>I guess the main takeaway I had from this book was that evil\ncan easily win out if good men are not willing to stand up for\nwhat they believe is right even in the face of possible vindictive\nconsequences.</p>\n<p>This book goes on my okay list. It was not great and I honestly\nwouldn't give it a strong recommendation unless the subject or\ngenre is particularly appealing to you. I wouldn't call it bad\neither, I would probably read it again if I had the choice to do\nit over but it wouldn't be dying to get to it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"An Officer and a Spy","date":"08 Feb 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","military","fiction","okay"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":357},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-02-08-an-officer-and-a-spy.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-02-08-an-officer-and-a-spy/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
