The main\npoint is that the culture of parenting in Paris is different than in America. She does a good job of\ndistilling the differences down to something digestable and beyond anecdote from her personal\nexperience. There are reasons for why the cultures have developed certain attitudes towards child\nrearing and these differences have an impact on the lives of both parents and children. Most of it\nis driving a narrative that the French system is better, but there are some tempering points about\nwhy things are not always \"better\".</p>\n<p>It is not worth going through the book point by point, but there are a few high level themes that I\ntook away. The main one being that children are complex humans with rich inner lives. The American\nway of viewing children tends to see them as not being too simple to have serious emotions and\nviewpoints and that they need to be constantly coddled. Parents think they need to be constantly\nentertaining and micromanaging children. The French view of children is that they need to be given\nspace and respect for their own inner selves to exist and interact with the world. This leads to\nthings like let children eat real food, make them eat in the same schedule as the rest of the\nfamily, let children spend time alone, give children wide freedom while they are inside a well\nstructured frame (cadre) but be strict at the boundaries.</p>\n<p>The other big point which I think might be difficult for me is to be strict. A parent must be the\none who ultimately decides and is the one who is firmly in charge. It sounds clear in theory, but I\ncan see how this would be difficult.</p>\n<p>Overall I enjoyed this book, and I am sure I will go back to it and check some things out when I am\nnot sure why nothing seems to be working.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bringing Up Bébé","date":"29 Jun 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","life","nonfiction","parenting"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":333},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-06-29-bringing-up-bebe.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-06-29-bringing-up-bebe/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
