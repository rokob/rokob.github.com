It was good I guess but it was also awful. The writing\nstyle did not work for me most of the time. At times I got into it and things moved along, but at\nother times it just annoyed me.</p>\n<p>The plot and characters were meh but it wasn't bad by any means. I think it just did not resonate\nthat well with me. Sometimes I felt connected, but mostly I didn't care that much. So overall I\nthought it was okay but I wouldn't recommend it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Intermezzo","date":"07 Feb 2025","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","okay"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":92},"fields":{"sha":"2d2ee6f92362e184ce3af6dfcd449142421f1d51"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2025-02-07-intermezzo.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2025-02-07-intermezzo/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
