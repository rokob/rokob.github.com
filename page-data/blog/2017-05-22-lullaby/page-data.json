Reading\n<a href=\"http://a.co/1w9bkvw\"><em>Lullaby</em></a> has solidified my opinion. Describing this book would be a spoiler, but\nI am not sure what else to do. <em>Lullaby</em> is about the magical and the mundane, both literally.\nI laughed a lot, but that is more indicitive of my personality that the character of the book.</p>\n<p>Most of the book is about the ability to kill people with words. There are some quoteable moments,\nlike in <em>Fight Club</em>, for instance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These people with a dead child, you want to tell them, go ahead. Blame yourself.\nThere are worse things you can do to the people you love than kill them. The regular way is just\nto watch the world do it. Just read the newspaper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are critiques of modern society interwoven with an unbelievable plot. Colorful language and\ncomplicated timelines. Clever oneliners, like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's not real. It's just a movie. We're the culture that cried wolf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Overall, if you like Chuck Palahniuk, then you have probably already read this book, or you really\nshould. I thought it was great. If you are looking for something short, weird, and yet still with\nthe ability to make you think a little bit, then pick this up.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Lullaby","date":"22 May 2017","categories":"book","tags":["book","death","fiction","great","life"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":212},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2017-05-22-lullaby.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017-05-22-lullaby/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
