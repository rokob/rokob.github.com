Typical. In fact, this is such a universal\nfact that the only reason I think people say \"the book\nwas better\" anymore is to prove they read or to establish\nthemselves as somehow above the normal movie going masses.\nWas the book better than the movie? Yes, no, it was the same\nbasic thing, but when your imagination gets to fill in gaps\nthat come pre-packaged in the visual format of cinema you are\nleft feeling like this is more satisfying because I was part of\nthe creative process.</p>\n<p>I do not want to get into a seemingly Ballardesque review of this\nbook (a term I just found out existed), that would be too easy.\nIt would be too easy to complain about society and especially\nthe stature of man today compared to yesteryear. However,\nI will say even though I am not nihilistic (most of the time),\nnor would I completely try to force this book into that philosophy,\nI will say it is definitely worth the read.</p>\n<p>My preference for writing style (or is it reading style) has been\nevolving the more I have been reading, but books like <em>Fight Club</em>\nhave always caught my attention. Books with an interesting rhythm,\na complicated plot, characters with witty lines, but even more\na bit of meta-wittiness that is somehow condescending of the book\nitself from within itself. It is difficult to pull off without coming\nacross as derivitive. I find that to be the problem with most\nmodern art, everyone is trying to be original, you cannot be accepted\nby doing something good within someone else's style even if the piece\nof work is enjoyable. Somehow everything has to be important.\n<em>Fight Club</em> could be original if you have not read anything else\nthat is similar before, it could be derivitive if you chose to overanalyze\nit along with many other works in the fucked up world genre, or you\ncould just lay back and enjoy it and stop being an asshole that tries\nto force everything into either the genius or crap categories. It's a great\nbook and a great movie. I look forward to reading more by Chuck Palahniuk.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fight Club","date":"11 Jan 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","society"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":383},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-01-11-fight-club.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-01-11-fight-club/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
