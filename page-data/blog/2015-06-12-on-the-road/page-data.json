It was an okay read, although\nI had trouble staying awake throughout as it was so random\nand without any real meaning. This book did not differ from other\nbooks that are considered \"classics\" but have been written\nwithin the past 100 years or so, it was not good. The writing is\ndifferent, that doesn't mean it is good, it is just non-standard.</p>\n<p>The beat generation was mostly a bunch of drug addicts who didn't\nknow what to do with themselves. I feel like every generation has\na feeling that they are different than those generations that came\nbefore, and because of this they try to find themselves through\nsome kind of existential experience. The idea of this book is\nthat traveling and expressing oneself completly in all situations\nis one path to finding IT. What is IT? Well you just have to know\nright?</p>\n<p>Seriously though, this book was mediocre, it was interesting only\nin that it was original and is a defining piece of work of that\nparticular group of people within that particular generation. I am not\nsure I would say that I recommend reading it if you are really looking\nfor a good read, but if you want to check something by Jack Kerouac off\nyour list then by all means give this a shot.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"On the Road","date":"12 Jun 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","okay","past","society"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":230},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-06-12-on-the-road.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-06-12-on-the-road/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
