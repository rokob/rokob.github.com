Just now as I sat down to write this I realized I coud have\nchecked this blog to find out if I had read it before and lo and behold <a href=\"/blog/2015-06-06-flow/\">I read it in\n2015</a>. This is somewhat disheartening as while reading it this time I\nhad a lot of profound thoughts about it being meaningful and how I want to change some things, but\nclearly I had some of these thoughts before and here I am.</p>\n<p>I was just about at the end of my time at Flexport and living in San Francisco when I read this book\nthe first time. In the past three years I have moved four times including to France, I learned to\nskydive, paraglide, base jump, how to ride a motorcycle. I met and married my wife, we now have a\nchild. I have worked at a few different places. The point of this short recollection is to remind\nmyself that yes I have clearly done some things, but I have not succeeding in implementing the\nunderlying message of this book throughout all aspects of my life.</p>\n<p>You can read my previous entry on this book for more details about this book, it all still holds.\nThe book was good, I agree with the ideas, and I fully believe that flow states are basically\nsynonomous with happiness. I am instead going to dive into where I have and have not found flow and\nwhy, and what I think I can do about it going forward.</p>\n<p>I have experienced the described flow state during many different activities of varying degrees. The\nshort list of activities that come to mind are: BASE jumping, skydiving, running, cycling, reading,\nrowing, writing, programming, mathematical research, studying/solving homework, spending time with people,\nplaying games, cooking, shooting. You could combine these based on some broad categories which is\ndone in the book, so we could get away with sports and games, intellectual, and interpersonal. There\nare overlaps especially in that sports and games involve intellectual as well as often\ninterpersonal actions, but this is good enough for now. My best flow moments have been in sports,\nespecially when there is some mental aspect as well. For example I can get into a flow state by\ndoing steady state running, but the real good times are racing or doing a workout that requires\nmental strength to push myself and to coordinate pacing. Flow occurs when your skills are balanced\nagainst the challenge you face towards a goal. You either veer into boredom by not having a hard\nenough challenge or you enter an \"anxiety\" state if the challenge is beyond your skills. In sports\nthis isn't really anxiety in so much as it usually manifests in physical failure or loss. That is a\ntype of anxiety in that it feels bad and is uncomfortable, but I think of as different than the\nanxiety one would experience in a more mental arena such as taking a test in a subject you know\nnothing about. There are some sports where the other side is very dangerous, namely BASE jumping and\nskydiving. It is worth taking a detour at this point a bit more into the concepts to help clarify my\nthoughts. Flow can be explained with two diagrams, the first is the simple one:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 400px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/f29f46f928dfbed5bf4af1aef90c5e1d/066f9/flow_simple.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 65.03067484662577%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Flow Diagram\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/f29f46f928dfbed5bf4af1aef90c5e1d/066f9/flow_simple.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f29f46f928dfbed5bf4af1aef90c5e1d/d2f63/flow_simple.jpg 163w,\n/static/f29f46f928dfbed5bf4af1aef90c5e1d/c989d/flow_simple.jpg 325w,\n/static/f29f46f928dfbed5bf4af1aef90c5e1d/066f9/flow_simple.jpg 400w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>We achieve flow when the challenges we face are balanced against our skills. Naturally by partaking\nin an activity we either increase our skill or increase the challenge we take on. Depending on the\nactivity one can stay in flow at the same skill/challenge point for a certain amount of time before\nwe start to move along one of the two axes. To get back into flow we have to move back along the\nother axis. Take running as an example. I can estimate pretty well the pace I can race a 5k at today\nwhere I would not have much left over at the end, but for which I could run even splits meaning that\nI didn't save too much for the end (boredom) or blow up and have to slow down to finish (anxiety).\nHowever, if I keep training, the next time I race I have to pick a new pace to run, too slow and my\nnew skill level was too high (I moved along the x-axis) so that I am not in flow but just bored. If\nI go too fast then I took on a challenge beyond my skill level (I moved along the y-axis too much)\nso that I blow up and end up in an anxious state.</p>\n<p>The second diagram expands on this graph to give names to other regions:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b3ebceb716337ad019e32552eccbc59f/5f6dd/flow_expanded.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 82.20858895705521%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Expanded Flow Diagram\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/b3ebceb716337ad019e32552eccbc59f/a6d36/flow_expanded.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b3ebceb716337ad019e32552eccbc59f/222b7/flow_expanded.png 163w,\n/static/b3ebceb716337ad019e32552eccbc59f/ff46a/flow_expanded.png 325w,\n/static/b3ebceb716337ad019e32552eccbc59f/a6d36/flow_expanded.png 650w,\n/static/b3ebceb716337ad019e32552eccbc59f/e548f/flow_expanded.png 975w,\n/static/b3ebceb716337ad019e32552eccbc59f/5f6dd/flow_expanded.png 1139w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>This diagram is a bit misleading as it seems like anxiety only occurs when your skill level somehow\ndeclines. The actual meaning of the axes is a bit ambigious as time is clearly somehow involved here\nbut is not made explicit. I don't actually like this diagram as much as I do the original, but it\nhelps to give some terminology for some other states. Some people are a bit more risk averse so they\nmight constantly find themselves in the control or relaxation regions, only sometimes breaking into\nflow. This can mean always building up skills to a sufficient level before deciding to up the\nchallenge. Other people are more risk seeking in that they prefer to spend their time in the arousal\nor anxiety states, again only occasionally breaking into flow. This means taking on challenges you\nare not ready for and building up the skill necessary while working on the challenge. Neither one of\nthese is objectively wrong, you have to move along one axis or the other and some activities lend\nthemselves to one approach or the other. It is very difficult to move along the diagonal because\nperfectly balancing the challenge with your skills requires a very nuanced challenge set as well as\na deep understanding of one's own skill level which is harder to know than it may seem.</p>\n<p>The downside of taking the risk adverse approach is that one may never know where flow actually lies\nbecause you could constantly be taking on challenges below your skill level. You can find yourself\nin situations doing less than your are capable because you are trying to avoid going too far over\nthe edge into anxiety.</p>\n<p>The downside of the risk seeking approach is that you might not be able to actually build up your\nskill in certain disciplines if you are constantly operating over your skill level. If every time\nyou run a race you flame out then it can be very difficult to improve over time as you are not\ngetting adequate feedback to modify your training. You are constantly putting yourself in situations\nyou can't handle. In some activites, say chess or tennis, your opponents will probably stop playing\nyou because you are just putting them into boredom because your skills are not up to snuff. In other\nactivities, say BASE jumping or skydiving, this approach will eventually kill you.</p>\n<p>Where am I? Well for some activities I take the risk seeking approach usually because I don't know\nmy limits. I prefer to lose spectacularly to help bound my upper limit rather than win and not\nreally know where I stand. That is, I prefer to go over the edge so I at least have a bound on where\nthe edge is. I have done this with rowing, running, cycling, research, programming, cooking, and\nwith social interactions. I have also done this a little bit in skydiving, but pulled back once I\nreally saw what the underlying siutation was.</p>\n<p>In rowing I raced in a national team selection regatta during my first year rowing a single. Clearly\nthis was beyond my level, but I didn't really know how far outside the realm of possibility it was,\nand I saw the downside as some temporary pain. I was way under experienced and outmatched, but I got\na good sense for where I stood. In running, when I was first starting to run longer distances I\nraced a 5k where my race plan was go out in second place and hold on for as long as I can. My splits\nwere something like 4:35, 6:15, 8:05. I imploded, but I didn't have a good sense for what my\npotential pace could be. I knew I was going to blow up, but I figured the best case was that I could\nhold on without dying too bad and worst case I could take the overall pace and that was my benchmark\nto try to beat with training. In cycling I had done a little bit of climbing in New Jersey and a few\nrides in the 30-40 mile range when I moved to Pasadena. There is a ride out and back there up to the\ntop of Mt Wilson which involves three category 1 climbs over about 60 miles. I took two bottles of\nwater, got up early, and went for it. My legs were shaking during the last climb which is on the way\nback, I could barely sit down without my hamstrings cramping, I wanted to stop so bad, I thought I\nwas going to pass out from the heat and exhaustion and just die on the side of the road. But I made\nit home, and subsequently passed out face down in full kit on my living room floor. After a couple\nweeks of better nutrition planning and training, I started doing that ride every week, but I didn't\nknow if it was really going to be hard or not without giving it a go.</p>\n<p>I can go on with examples where I have taken the risk seeking approach in my life within these\nactivies and more. I know the consequences of the anxiety state in most of these activities is just\na lot of temporary pain, so I am willing to take that risk for the purpose of getting a baseline. I\ndon't want to be in that red zone, but I think the benefits outweight the temporary risk for\ngathering information. In almost all circumstances where I went out over the edge, it set me up really\nwell for understanding where I was and how to train. If I went over the edge again it was because of\na miscalculation and it was almost certainly not very far over, rather just a little bit of pushing\nmyself into the arousal state.</p>\n<p>In some contexts it can be hard to accurately assess your skill level and therefore you can operate\nin the anxiety zone without knowing it. In fact, you can experience something like flow which is the\nresult of a positive outcome to an outlier situation where you overcame your lack of skill. This is\npossible if you play a game against a superior opponent and they have an off day. If you play them\na few times, the skill should win out (ignoring games of pure chance) and you will realize that you\nwere not actually ready for that challenge. However after the first game it can be easy to delude\noneself into believing their skill level is higher than it actually is. In pure physical contests\nagainst a clock like running, if you hit the time then you were up for the challenge in some sense.\nI had one 2k on the erg where I chose a goal pace that was too aggressive for my skill level,\nhowever I held on and hit the time. I paid for this by blacking out for a little bit, throwing up\nintermittanly for a couple hours, and being sick for a couple days afterwards. So was I up to the\nchallenge just because I pulled it off? On one hand yes because I did it, but realistically no\nbecause it was certainly not a flow experience. I did a different 2k on the erg where I was in flow\nthe whole time and it was an amazing experience. The goals were similar and the end times were\nsimilar, but the experience was worlds apart. This focus on the actual experience is the key to\nunderstanding the positive nature of flow as a guiding principle.</p>\n<p>What happens when you take on a challenge that is well beyond your skill level in skydiving or BASE? You\nmight have a lot of fun and misassess your skill level to be on par with the challenge. Or you might\nbe seriously injured or die. Or you might just not have fun as you end up away from the group or\noverly nervous the whole time where you fail to really accomplish the goal. The most likely event is\nthat it is kinda fun because it is still a jump, you partially accomplish the goal and you set\nyour expectations for your skill level accordingly. Besides injury or death, the worst case scenario\nis the first one where you think you are better than you are.</p>\n<p>The two most dangerous situations in skydiving and BASE jumping are overestimating your skill level\nmost likely due to getting away with things that are beyond you without having the mental clarity to\ntell the difference, and being complacent which manifests itself in the relaxation zone on the above\ngraph where your skills are very high so you take challenges less seriously. Newer jumpers are\nkilled by overestimating their abilities whereas complacency kills the experienced.</p>\n<p>BASE jumping, in my limited experience, is the apogee of the flow experience as it pertains to\nsports. Moreover, I find sports to be the most natural avenue for flow. The concept is strongly\nconnected to games and can be introduced into other areas via gamification so this makes sense.</p>\n<p>I want to put interpersonal relationships and love/sex into a different category as I don't really\ncompare talking to my wife with going for a run. The experience of loving and being loved lives on\nits own plane. One can call this flow as in there is work required to continue to stay engaged and\nenjoy the experience, but it is different than say sports or reading.</p>\n<p>Looking back on some of the things I have done in my life where I would say I was happiest or would\nlove to do again, it is easy to see they were times where I was in flow. I had set goals, the goals\nwere not too easy but they are achievable, I worked on my skills to take on challenges which gave me\nfeedback and I progressed this way until hitting my goal. I then made new goals and repeated the\nprocess.</p>\n<p>Or the dark side hit. I met my goal, but I assumed that it was the activity itself that I really\nenjoyed regardless of the goal so I tried to keep going without a concrete structure. This works for\na little bit as unstructured play within something I enjoy is fun for a while. But eventually I\nstart to get bored and I don't know why. Rather than setting new goals I will often start to do the\nthing less and less. This is a sad state of affairs when I look back on it becaue it is obvious in\nhindsight.</p>\n<p>I am going to start setting some more concrete goals for the things I enjoy doing and be more\ncognizant of the anxiety/flow/boredom states. Rather than feeling bored with something I am doing, I\nneed to take a step back and think about what my goals are including if I even have any. The second\ntime around with this book has really been much more useful. I believe that my attempts to live a\nlife more like what I want than just going through the motions over the past three years is a large\npart of why I am ready to internalize this now.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Flow (again)","date":"20 Aug 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","nonfiction","philosophy"]},"timeToRead":10,"wordCount":{"words":2683},"fields":{"sha":"d622f926c4a87f7b44356e76e1ff5111adea49f2"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-08-20-flow-again.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-08-20-flow-again/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
