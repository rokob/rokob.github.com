I would classify these both as literary\nscience fiction, if that is a thing. Altogether very different from the first, but stylistically the\nsame. We get to experince the story from a different character's perspective and this made the pair\nof books much more fulfilling. Sadly this did not make the movie any more comprehensible.</p>\n<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this book at times, especially now that it is over. However, reading it was\nreally a drag. It had this feeling of over writing. I don't really know where to classify this one.\nI am calling it okay, and I recommend it, only if you have read the first one. But I can't call it\ngood because it was so often annoying in how it dragged on with this abstruse language. I will\nprobably still read the last installment just to find out how everything gets tied up.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Authority","date":"22 Apr 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","okay","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":160},"fields":{"sha":"3a23f0ef6a8f1235cb8656de6d03275c3729a226"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-04-22-authority.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-04-22-authority/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
