The generic summary hooked me\nenough to add it to my list and I am happy that I did. You can think of this book\nas something like Gone Girl set in England, but clearly altogether different. There\nis a missing woman and some twists and turns, otherwise it is basically not similar.\nNonetheless, I enjoy books that treat me like an adult and don't try to overexplain\nsimple things, or that give things away too early.</p>\n<p>I didn't really get too much out of this book in terms of something provocative to\nthink about, but I was entertained. I am usually disappointed in narrators that are\nweak, as this one clearly was. It is tough for me to identify with their whining and\ncomplaining. For some reason, many books have highly flawed protagonists nowadays. I am\nnot sure if this is a trend in modern literature or just something I am noticing more\noften that was always there if you read the right (or maybe wrong) things. I still\nclearly recommend this book, but beware that the main character can be a bit trying\nat times.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Girl on the Train","date":"17 May 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","good","fiction","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":226},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-05-17-the-girl-on-the-train.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-05-17-the-girl-on-the-train/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
