Basically, there was a list\non Amazon of books and I picked this one seemingly at random.\nIt was okay, not good, not bad, just okay.</p>\n<p>The book has an interesting premise, crimes against little girls\nseems to be a theme this January. The writing was trying too\nhard at times to be overly literary. It was distracting from\nthe point and made it difficult to follow what was really\ngoing on. Now I know that can sometimes be an artistic style, but\nI don't think it worked that well in this book.</p>\n<p>The worst part about this book is that it is almost like a\nsnapshot of some people's lives. There wasn't a clear\ndelineation between acts. No crescendo. No real twists\nor turns. It was just kind of a slice of life with some\nfucked up shit going on. Well I personally don't think\nit is that fucked up, but most people who characterize\nit as such.</p>\n<p>I would not really recommend this book, unless you\nare really bored and don't mind not really finding\nany closure. I mean the main event that spurs most\nof the plot is not even described well enough to\nreally get a full picture of what happened. The book\nwas more frustrating to me than satisfying. But, at\nthe same time, I wouldn't call it bad, it was still\na captivating read, even though I felt let down when\nI was finally finished.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"See How Small","date":"30 Jan 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","crime","okay"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":254},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-01-30-see-how-small.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-01-30-see-how-small/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
