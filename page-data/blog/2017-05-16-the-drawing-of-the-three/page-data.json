Having enjoyed the first book, but armed with the\nknowledge that they only get better, I dove into this supremely strange book. Part of my plan was to\nget through most of these books before seeing the movie, and based on my current pace I might get\nthrough one or two more.</p>\n<p>The first book was odd, but nowhere near as much as the second. It appears that things are just\ngetting going, so probably the oddities are just beginning. Nevertheless, this is a good book. I\nwould not call it great, but that might change after reading more of the books. I was left with so\nmany questions that it is hard not to just go straight to book number three next. I want to spread\nout some of my reading, but we will see how that goes.</p>\n<p>I recommend the series already, so get started on the first book before going to this one, and\nhopefully I can finish them all to really make a statement about how this fits in.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Drawing of the Three","date":"16 May 2017","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":194},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2017-05-16-the-drawing-of-the-three.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017-05-16-the-drawing-of-the-three/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
