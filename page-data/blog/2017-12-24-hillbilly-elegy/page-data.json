Taya and I had both been to many weddings in the past where we were less than\nenthused with the party favor. Not that we expected something better as in we wanted a gift, but\nrather that we would prefer nothing over a forced cliche. Some people have done better, in\nparticular, she told me of a wedding where in lieu of individual gifts, the whole wedding had\nadopted a rhino. Thinking about our wedding, and are desire to make it true to who we are, we put\nsome thought into this wedding favor. This long process eventually led us to decide to buy each\nwedding guest a book. We decided to get a unique book for each person, one that represented\nsomething about us as well as matched the person we were giving it to. This was a bit of an\nundertaking, but 60+ books later and now that the whole process is over, we both think it was a\ngreat idea. One book that we decdied to get was <a href=\"http://a.co/2p4wpcQ\"><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em></a>. Granted most of the\nbooks we gave people we had a connection with, a handful were selected more for the particular\nindividual along with our own desire for the book. This one neither of us had read before giving it\naway, but I finally got around to reading it and I am really happy with our choice.</p>\n<p><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> has many insightful moments. The best, or possibly worst, part is how much of the\nstory tied in with my own life. I was not economically poor as a child, my parents did not divorce,\nwe did not live in a poor town. Nonetheless, there are still quite a lot of similarities in how I\nwas raised, where my values came from, and how I interact with the world (for better and worse).</p>\n<p>Now part of my perception of the downside of this book could be fully colored by that prior\nstatement about how I was grew up, but too much of this book comes across as selling his\naccomplishments or his perceived accomplishments. Even writing that I disagree with. I don't know\nhow to say it, but parts of the book just read like too simple of a linear narrative describing the\nsequence of his life. It was like \"I went to school, then I graduated, then I went to the Marines.\"\nParts of that straight narrative got to the point where it felt too much like he was just telling me\nthings he had done and less about why I should care. The first half of the book was more heavily\nladen with insight into the culture and evolution of poor white people. As the book progressed into\nhis more recent past, it read more like a retelling of what he has been up to for the past few years\nrather than disecting that life.</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong though, he definitely sprinkles insights throughout the book. Even near the end,\nexplaining how his current actions are colored by both his origins but also what he has learned\nby moving to the other side of the tracks.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend this book as a view into a large portion of America that is largely invisible\noutside of where it is happening. As a bonus, it is quite short. It would have been significantly\nworse had he tried to stretch it out any longer like some other memoirs I have read.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hillbilly Elegy","date":"24 Dec 2017","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","life","nonfiction","personality","relationships","society"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":596},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2017-12-24-hillbilly-elegy.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017-12-24-hillbilly-elegy/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
