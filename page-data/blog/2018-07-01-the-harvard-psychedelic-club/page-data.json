I had a decent understanding of the major events the book covers, but less so\nthe specific details of the lives of the major players. The book is probably best understood if you\nhave experienced some psychedelics, but the history is interesting regardless.</p>\n<p>I have pretty strong opinions about drugs and their place in our legal system. This book is more\nbiography than history and therefore does not delve too deeply into the details of the changing\nlandscape of laws around psychedelics and all drugs as a whole in the United States during this time\nperiod. Timothy Leary did more damage than anyone else to the potential for a more reasonable\nlegal doctrine surrounding most drugs than any. One might say Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters did\nmore damage, which I would concede is possible. But I would have liked a bit more in depth coverage\nof the legal ramifications of the Harvard Psilocybin Project.</p>\n<p>Overall this is a decent overview of the project at Harvard which is an interesting part of history\nif you are not aware of it. The book however falls a bit short as it tries to be a biography of four\npeople in under 300 pages. Worth a read if you want the basic gist, but lacks a lot of depth.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Harvard Psychedelic Club","date":"01 Jul 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","drugs","good","history","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":237},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-07-01-the-harvard-psychedelic-club.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-07-01-the-harvard-psychedelic-club/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
