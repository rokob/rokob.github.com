Of the six choices for January, I decided to pick\n<a href=\"http://amzn.com/B00ZX99WE8\"><em>The Moonlit Garden</em></a>. I probably would not\nhave picked up this book otherwise, and after reading it\nI would not really jump to read something by this author\nagain. Although the book was ultimately not bad, it was not\nmy style and I think the overall quality of the book was\nmediocre.</p>\n<p><em>The Moonlit Garden</em> is essentially a novel about romance and\nfinding oneself with a treasure hunt as the driver of the\nnarrative. That description maybe oversells it a bit much as\neven that sounds more interesting to me than what this book\nturned out to be. I did find the book to be enjoyable in that\nI was invested enough to want to find out how the mystery would\nbe solved. However, the writing was a bit disjointed, and\noften times it lacked a clear audience. Some of the dialogue\nsounded like it was written for children and then other times\nit seemed much more for an adult audience. It really felt like\nshe wrote parts of this, and then lost some enthusiasm as she\nhad to finish other parts. Maybe that is just poor editing\nwhich polished certain areas more than others.</p>\n<p>If you have a thing for female narrators going on adventures\nand talking about their feelings for some guy she barely knows\nthen this book might be for you. Otherwise, I would probably\nskip it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Moonlit Garden","date":"13 Jan 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","history","okay"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":261},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-01-13-the-moonlit-garden.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-01-13-the-moonlit-garden/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
