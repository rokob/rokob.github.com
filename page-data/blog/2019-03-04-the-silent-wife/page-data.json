As we share Kindle books, I decided to give it a whirl, boy is it a\nterrible book. Here is a literal quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The mottled sky squats low over the lake, spitting rain like a large animal relieving itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apparently they are going to turn this into a movie. Someone in Hollywood thinks that a shitty\nrelationship and misogyny is what made <em>The Girl on the Train</em> and <em>Gone Girl</em> worthwhile and are\ntherefore committed to skimming the barrel for anything similar. I could not figure out who I\ndisliked more. Every character has something to hate. Everyone is at fault for this train wreck.</p>\n<p>However, there is a doggo who is really caught up in the struggle. I will say that the guy is much\nmore of a piece of shit for just leaving the dog seemingly without thought for what his absence does\nto the dog's psyche.</p>\n<p>Stay far away from this terrible book unless you want to cringe at both the writing and the content.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Silent Wife","date":"04 Mar 2019","categories":"book","tags":["bad","book","fiction","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":187},"fields":{"sha":"04aa634a0d0ab05758f7da3d6ab1b96a59a1f075"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2019-03-04-the-silent-wife.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2019-03-04-the-silent-wife/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
