Due to recent\ndevelopments in politics, this book as well as <em>1984</em> are once again best sellers, and after having\nread this one I can understand why.</p>\n<p>This book makes you think about how\neasy it can be to just go with the flow, but how dire the consequences of that path of least\nresistance can potentially be.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We lived, as usual, by ignoring. Ignoring isn't the same as ignorance, you have to work at it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There were parts of the book written in a different style which seemed to signify a different\nmeaning. The parts at night were more loose and dream like, explaining what goes on at night can\nfeel that way. The ending was a bit weird, I had one interpretation of it that made me feel better\nabout it later on, but initially it was annoying. I highly recommend the book, and now I can watch\nthe show.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Handmaid's Tale","date":"30 May 2017","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":186},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2017-05-30-the-handmaid-s-tale.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017-05-30-the-handmaid-s-tale/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
