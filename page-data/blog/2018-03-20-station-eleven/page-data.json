The setting is before, during, and after a pandemic that wipes out the\nmajority of the population and therefore brings our modern world to a halt. The narrative jumps back\nand forth across time and between narrator in a style that worked for me. Overall a good book that I\nwould certainly recommend, but which I found lacking due to the span of time and potential to\nexplore this future world.</p>\n<p>I find it hard to fault a book for not spreading itself thin to cover all of the different\ninteresting facets of this post-apocolyptic world it created it. Nonetheless, there are so many\nquestions left unanswered. In itself that is the point. When the world crumbles, we are left as\nindividuals to hold on to what we were or make something new of ourselves. Those living through this\ncollapse are also suffering from unanswered questions, hope and deinal which eventually lead to\nacceptance. The focus on one set of characters woven from decades before to decades after the event\nleads to a sense of being one of them. You only know as much as they do and therefore that sense of\nnot knowing is felt alongside them.</p>\n<p>Parts of this story were particularly interesting to me after reading <a href=\"/blog/2018-02-26-the-great-leveler/\"><em>The Great\nLeveler</em></a>. I had all of these thoughts about how this flu\nwas affecting wealth distributions and income inequality. This book took the flu lethality to the\nextreme, worse than anything in history, so that the destruction was almost complete. The largest\ngrouping of people that we hear of is a few hundred by twenty years after. That sort of decimation\nwould obviously lead to a leveling of inequality. I had feelings like this was almost too extreme of\na scenario for the real interesting parts to play out. I was hoping for more tribal issues or\nrebuilding efforts. While there were hints of these themes, they were mostly missing.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Station Eleven","date":"20 Mar 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":337},"fields":{"sha":"3a23f0ef6a8f1235cb8656de6d03275c3729a226"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-03-20-station-eleven.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-03-20-station-eleven/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
