None of them are liteary masterpieces,\nbut they are still quite entertaining and fun to read.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed the first two and I had to wait a bit for the third one to come out so\nI was pretty excited to see how things would turn out. Usually in trilogies, the\nthird installment is a let down because the expectations are built up and everyone\nhas their own idea of how things should end that no matter what happens you are\nusually disappointed. I thought this series ended pretty much the only way you could\nimagine it ending. Luckily there were enough twists and turns along the way there that\nit did not matter that you knew in the back of your mind where it was going.</p>\n<p>I have been reading much slower this year, mostly because I have been spending a lot\nof my time doing something else. That being said, this is still a very quick read\nif you want it to be. I definitely recommend this series if you are into scifi\nand liked The Hunger Games. I would not be surprised to see these books turned\nin to a movie series, although with all of the futuristic gadgets and spaceships\nit might end up being a CGI nightmare.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Morning Star","date":"15 Apr 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":233},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-04-15-morning-star.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-04-15-morning-star/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
