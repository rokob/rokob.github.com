Ideally this would be some noble cause that leads to a policy recommendation for how we\ncan address the current state of increasing inequality. But alas he finds that the only consistent\ncauses of reduced inequality of any noticable scale were the result of violence. The more violent\nthe compression.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend reading both this book as well as <a href=\"/blog/2017-01-23-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century/\"><em>Capital in the 21st\nCentury</em></a> with the latter being first. It\nis important to understand inequality both in income and wealth, both historically and currently,\nand across different countries before one asks how this has changed. Piketty's book will give you\nthat foundation in the numbers based on the best currently available data. Whether you agree with\nhim or not is irrelevant, the presentation of the data is all that is important for this particular\nbook.</p>\n<p>Summarizing this book is actually somewhat easy. First, one needs to understand that there is a\nlimit to inequality dependent on how much surplus exists beyond the minimum amount of income\nrequired to keep people alive. Therefore looking at absolute inequality or the quality of life of\npeople at the bottom over different periods in time can be misleading. Second, wealth and income are\ntwo different things and inequality can exist in both, one or the other, or neither within the same\nsociety. It is rare for them not to be somewhat linked, but it is feasible depending on a lot of\ndifferent economic factors. Nonetheless the distinction is not all that important for the broad\nstrokes of the argument.</p>\n<p>With that out of the way, there have only been a handful of periods in history where\nsocieties have moved from high levels of inequality to low levels of inequality (where high and low\nare relative). All of those times have had an a precipitating event or events that was violent in\nnature. There have been periods where inequality has shifted peacefully but it has either been very\nminimal in degree or it was shortly reverted due to some violent backlash. Moreover, the extent of\nthe violence goes hand in hand with the extent of the leveling.</p>\n<p>There are four main sources of leveling in history: mass mobilization warfare, revolution, state\ncollapse, and epidemics. Mass mobilization is speficied with war as typical war that does not\ninvolve the entire country mobilizing all of its resources to the effort has not had equalizing\neffects.</p>\n<p>The downside to this observation is that nothing else has ever worked. Moreover we are moving\ntowards increasing inequality. Hence, we are going to keep getting more unequal until something\nviolent happens. The scale of that violence would have to be unprecedented because of the current\nstructure of our modern economies.</p>\n<p>He does go in to why we have inequality in the first place and to a limited degree discusses whether\nthis is good or bad. First,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the concentration of resources in the hands of the few [come from] two principal factors: economic\ndevelopment and predatory behavior by those powerful enough to appropriate wealth well in excess\nof what their activities might earn them in competitive markets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So inequality comes from actual economic progress but also from predatory behavior. The predatory\nbehavior does not have to be obviously negative, but means basically rent taking in economic terms.\nThis can manifest for example in CEO compensation growing beyond any reasonable link to economic\ndevelopment beyond their ability to extract that extra rent through whatever means they have\navailable.</p>\n<p>We have also seen that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>assortative mating--more specifically, the growing economic similarity of marriage partners--has\nwidened gaps between households and has been credited with causing some 25 percent to 30 percent\nof the overall increase in American earnings inequality between 1967 and 2005.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Along with the fact that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>between 1913 and 2008, the development of top income shares closely tracked the degree of\npolarization but with a lag of about a decade: changes in the latter preceded changes in the\nformer but generally moved in the same direction--first down, then up. ... Thus elite incomes in\ngeneral and those in the finance sector in particular have been highly sensitive to the degree of\nlegislative cohesion and have benefited from worsening gridlock.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The future does not look bright.</p>\n<p>I found one line particularly fascinating</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>higher schooling premiums are associated with lower intergenerational earnings mobility</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that if you live in a country where the return to an additional year of schooling is\nhigh, there is less likelihood for children to end up in different income brackets than their\nparents. This is the opposite of what one might naively expect. That is, a typical free market view\nthat everyone is equal to earn what they work for would say that if I study and go to school and\nwork hard then I have just as much chance to make money as anyone else who also does. The idea being\nthat if I put more time into school so that I get paid more for my more schooling then children in\nlower economic classes just need to stay in school to move economic classes. But that is so\nblatently false based on the data and moreover in the US in particular where the schooling premium is\nquite high, the level intergenerational mobility is laughable to the point that anyone who believes\nAmerica is an equal playing field is delusional.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Great Leveler","date":"27 Feb 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","great","history","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":4,"wordCount":{"words":928},"fields":{"sha":"3a23f0ef6a8f1235cb8656de6d03275c3729a226"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-02-26-the-great-leveler.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-02-26-the-great-leveler/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
