Always. We subscribe to the New York Times to be delivered in paper\nform on Sundays, I always go right for the book review. Usually there is something in there to make\nme think about what to read next. I also periodically trawl through\n<a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/\"><em>The Paris Review</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/\"><em>The New York Review of Books</em></a>,\nand various <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/charts/mostsold/fiction\"><em>Amazon charts</em></a>. I have yet to find a\ndefinitive source of material. Although the winners of the Man Booker Prize have been a consistent\nset of good reads.</p>\n<p>I have <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/14J4VJT6POI2Q?&#x26;sort=default\">this Amazon list</a> which I constantly add books to and then buy five or six at a\ntime. The list is not really sorted, it is I think just based on when I added the books to the list.\nI used to try to keep it in order based on what I wanted to read next. Instead I just look through\nit whenever I am finishing the last book of my previous batch purchase and pick a few to read. The\nconsequence is that some things have been on there for a few years, languishing away at the bottom.</p>\n<p>I don't trust best seller lists because they are a proxy for quality and tend to be not the best\nproxy at that. People tend to buy what is on the best seller list, making membership on the list\nalmost tautological. Amazon does recommended books, and they know basically every book I have read\nin the past few years, but it seems like their recommendations are boosting things they are trying\nto push rather than doing a good job of collabrative filtering. I would like a search engine where I\ncan pick a few characteristics and maybe some other books that might be similar to what I am looking\nfor and it would give me ideas. For music I know of some work in this field doing acoustic analysis\nof songs, but I haven't seen anything for books.</p>\n<p>Last year I read a lot more non-fiction than usual. That might be a trend that continues as there\nare quite a few non-fiction subjects I am currently interested in. However, I might do a better job\nof throwing two to three fiction books in between each non-fiction rather than reading non-fiction\nback to back.</p>\n<p>Next up is <em>Iron Gold</em> which is the fourth book in the Red Rising series. That is the last in my\nlast group of purchases. My next chunk will be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Foreign Influence</em> by Brad Thor</li>\n<li><em>The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell</em> by Aldous Huxley</li>\n<li><em>Ice</em> by Anna Kavan</li>\n<li><em>Asymmetry</em> by Lisa Halliday</li>\n<li><em>In a Dark, Dark Wood</em> by Ruth Ware</li>\n<li><em>The Real Lolita</em> by Sarah Weinman</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That has four fiction and two non-fiction. There are some really interesting books in that chunk\nwhich I am excited about. The Brad Thor book is my guily pleasure, book nine in the Scot Harvath\nseries. The Huxley book is one I am surprised I haven't gotten around to reading before and is long\noverdue. <em>Ice</em> comes from The Paris Review about lesser known female authors. <em>Asymmetry</em> is on a\nfew best of 2018 lists and sounded good. <em>In a Dark, Dark Wood</em> has been sitting on the bottom of my\nlist for a long time so time to pull the trigger. <em>The Real Lolita</em> I heard about on NPR and is\nquite interesting, particularly because I had a weird interaction with the <em>Lolita</em> having decided\nto try to listen to the audiobook. Hopefully this non-fiction book isn't as weird as listening to\nJeremy Irons talking about pedophilia while riding my bike.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What I'm thinking of reading","date":"02 Jan 2019","categories":"life","tags":["life","musings","reading"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":604},"fields":{"sha":"49e80f0e06407657705f8b9bd120be452466c86e"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2019-01-02-what-i-m-thinking-of-reading.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2019-01-02-what-i-m-thinking-of-reading/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
