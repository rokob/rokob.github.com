The writing style\nis one that I personally like, where each chapter is from the\nperspective of a different person at a different point in time,\nthat keeps you guessing as it revels information in little bits\nuntil the final convergence of the different threads near the end.\nI am really happy I started my reading year off right with this one.</p>\n<p>I wonder how difficult it is to write a book that is highly localized\nif you do not live in that area or you are not from there. Much of this\nstory revolves around the intimate knowledge of a backwater part of\nGeorgia. I am pretty sure even if I tried there is no way I could have\ngotten the details just right for someone who grew up in that area.\nThen again, much of the details are specific enough to be any particular\nplace that you have never been, seeing as this is a fictional area.\nI find that many authors set their stories near where they grew up,\nor in a parallel place where it makes sense to use their upbringing\nto fill in the gaps. It would be interesting to try to go to\nsome area I am not from, live amongst the people for a little while,\nand try to write something that feels like it was written by a local.\nA sort of literary tourism.</p>\n<p>Reading this much has gotten me thinking that I need to start writing\nfiction again. I guess I never really did that too much outside of school,\nbut whenever I did I really enjoyed it. This blog might be a good place to\nwrite some short stories. If I can hammer something out I will throw\nit up here. I have a few ideas that I think would be good books,\nbut who doesn't?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bull Mountain","date":"02 Jan 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","fiction","great"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":323},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-01-02-bull-mountain.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-01-02-bull-mountain/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
