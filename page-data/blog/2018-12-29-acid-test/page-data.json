The\nsubtitle is \"LSD, Ecstasy, and the Power to Heal\" which is basically descriptive of the theme.</p>\n<p>The focus of this book is on theraputic uses of various psychoactive compounds including LSD and\nMDMA, but also DMT as well as a smattering of others. It reminded me of <a href=\"/blog/2018-07-01-the-harvard-psychedelic-club/\"><em>The Harvard Psychedelic Club</em></a>\nin the format being many small chapters focusing on a particular individual. I already knew the\nvague story of most of the MDMA related history, but there are a lot of details which are very\ninteresting.</p>\n<p>More than once this book has come up with people saying they are surprised I haven't read it. I am\nglad I have now because it is good, informative, and made me think about certain theraputic use\ncases in a different way. There is quite a bit of illicit self medicating using these compounds, but\nthe idea of having a focused therapy using some of these drugs as supplements is something I have\npondered but never really given serious thought. It always seemed obvious that they would be useful,\nbut I never took the next step to think of what real therapy would actually look like.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend this book if you do not know the history of MDMA in America. I plan to add a\ncouple other books to my reading this spurred by mentions in this one.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Acid Test","date":"29 Dec 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","drugs","good","history","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":251},"fields":{"sha":"fd4304bcc8e86e896c3dba95889557b0cdda8b87"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-12-29-acid-test.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-12-29-acid-test/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
