Amazon\nhas good recommendations if I want to read similar books to what I\nhave read already. This is not the worst thing if I like the books\nthat I have been reading, but it also reinforces certain genres. When\nI want to step out and try something new, I have looked at best seller\nlists as well as any other random lists I can find. A very small number\nof books come from one off recommendations. <a href=\"http://amzn.com/B00V37BC4C\"><em>Furiously Happy</em></a>\ncomes from a best seller list. I was specifically looking for\nsomething non-fiction, and this came up, I think I picked it because\nit sounded funny and the cover was amusing.</p>\n<p>This book was closer to good than okay, but it definitly was not in the same\ncategory as the other books that I have called good. There were many times\nwhen I was laughing out loud at her stories. There were other times that\nI found some interesting tidbits that I could really relate too, for instance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I tried to protest but I was a bit too nauseous to point out that I\nonly do it when we have excellent service or when the waiter refills\nmy Diet Coke without my having to ask for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is interesting to me because I will excessively tip any waiter who\nrefills my Diet Coke without my having to ask for it. I did not know anyone\nelse had these same feelings. Which was another theme of the book, that\njust talking about issues she has had, she has found people who have told\nher that they too have those feelings or issues and that she is not alone.\nFrom what I understand this can be very useful for people with certain\nmental illnesses.</p>\n<p>There were also some interesting quotes and ideas that were just generally\ninsightful, such as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It doesn't mean I'm a failure at appreciating the good things in life.\nIt means I'm successful in recognizing what the good things in life\nare <em>for me</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although, there were a lot of moments that just got repeatitive and\ncame across as whiny. I get it that she has issues that she cannot\ncontrol due to a chemical imbalance, but the tone got to be pretty\nannoying which really dragged on the flow of the book.</p>\n<p>If you have severe social anxiety or some form of depression or bipolar\nthen there are probably some bits and pieces in here that you would\nfind relatable. Depending on your sense of humour, you will either be\nchuckling a little bit or laughing hysterically out loud.\nI certainly recommend this book because it is pretty short and I like\nthings that are funny. However, you may find it hard to finish all\nof the stories at times just because of the tedium.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Furiously Happy","date":"24 Dec 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","introversion","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":493},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-12-24-furiously-happy.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-12-24-furiously-happy/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
