Other experiments and questionable\npractices from inside Google, Amazon, and Facebook have been made public\nbefore and the level of furor was nothing like this. This is a small fraction\nof the news that the recent NSA revelations has gotten, but it is still\npretty close. That is something that many people have basically known was\ngoing on for years and no one said anything about it until someone from\nthe inside brought out proof. Maybe that is metaphorically why this is\neasier to hold on to and point at, but what I say below is more of a\nquestion of why the people who claim\nto care the most about this have not been louder. Maybe they have been trying\nto and finally people are listening. Either way, from my point of view, this\npublic discourse on the ethics of experimentation seems new, and I am just\ntrying to say why now? I do understand why people are upset, I don't think\nthis particular test was unethical because of the minimal risk of real harm\nbeing to done to participants which is generally accepted by university\ninternal review boards as one case where consent is unnecessary. This post\nwas never intended to say that something is okay (or not okay), it was only\nintended to put the words attributed to me within the context that I said\nthem which I guess is even less clear than I thought.</p>\n<h3>On the title:</h3>\n<p>Apparently it is non-obvious, but the title of this post is a jab at the way\n\"news\" is presented nowadays.</p>\n<h3>Disclaimer:</h3>\n<p>Anything contained within this post that resembles something that may or may not have\nactually happened at Facebook while I worked there is purely coincidental and does not\nconstitute a breach of a non-disclosure agreement which may or may not exist between\nmyself and said company.</p>\n<h2>The Short Version</h2>\n<p>A reporter reached out to me about this experiment that was the subject of a <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full\">recent paper</a>\npublished by some members of the Data Science team at Facebook. I don't know how he found me originally,\nbut we talked a few weeks prior about Facebook in general which did not end up in the newspaper in any\nway, so I did not think much of talking to him again. He told me he was just looking for background information\non a story about the data science team in general about how they work and some things related to how this\nexperiment was run. So I said that sounds reasonable and we talked for at least 45 minutes about testing\nand experimentation, which led to a bunch of other stuff. If you know me or have talked to me you know\nhow I tend to meander around when talking about something. I thought I was even overly positive about\nthe work being done, talking about how everyone is trying really hard to make the product better\nthrough understanding.</p>\n<p>Because of all the talk about this experiment, I thought it was pretty reasonable to write something\nmore general about the data science team independent of just this experiment. He focused a little bit\non whether there was a review board for running tests and I honestly said no, not back in 2012, maybe now,\nbut I doubt it, I didn't think much of that, I tried to clarify that I wasn't really on the data science\nteam, that I worked on SI, so my experience with running tests was quite different as they were never\nintended for publication.</p>\n<p>So anyway, he told me their editors don't allow them to show things before they are published, but he told\nme he could tell me the overall theme of what he was writing, but he refused to do it via email,\nand I eventually felt like I expressed that if I cant see it then I don't think he should be\nquoting me, which led to him saying well it is going to be published anyway and he thinks he\naccurately captured what I had told him.</p>\n<h2>The Real Context</h2>\n<p>All of the quotes from me are out of context, although they are pretty much actual quotes. Some of them\nwere twisted around and basically pieced together from two different sentences to sound like one, but\nall of them got the tone and nuance completely opposite of what I actually said. I talked to the guy who wrote\nthat story for more than half an hour from which he pulled that handful of quotes. He definitely spun the words\nI technically did say to further his ends of painting Facebook in a negative light. I am going to try and\nspeak here to how I actually feel about things and if you recognize some quotes you will see the context\nfrom which they came.</p>\n<p>While I was at Facebook, there was no institutional review board that scrutinized the decision to\nrun an experiment for internal purposes. Once someone had a result that they decided they wanted to\nsubmit for publication to a journal, there definitely was a back and forth with PR and legal\nover what could be published. If you want to run a test to see if people will click on a\ngreen button instead of a blue button you don't need approval. In the same way, if you want to\ntest a new ad targeting system to see if people click on more ads and revenue goes up, you don't\nneed institutional approval. Further, if you want to see how people react to changes in certain\nsystems like the content in news feed, you don't need approval for that experiment, even if it is\njust to help inform an internal ranking system. Nonetheless, people aren't just running experiments\nwilly-nilly. There are only a small subset of people on the data science team who have social science\nresearch as part of their primary job duties. Everyone else would not run an experiment like the one\npeople are talking about because it would not help the product they are working on. Those who do run\nsuch experiments, have very high ethical standards and experience running experiments both inside and\noutside academia. They are trying to make Facebook a better product for over a billion people, and the\nway they know how to do that is to understand human behaviour and the human-computer interaction.\nExperiments are run on every user at some point in their tenure on the site. Whether that is seeing\ndifferent size ad copy, or different marketing messages, or different call to action buttons, or having\ntheir feeds generated by different ranking algorithms, etc. The fundamental purpose of most people\nat Facebook working on data is to influence and alter people's moods and behaviour. They are doing\nit all the time to make you like stories more, to click on more ads, to spend more time on the site.\nThis is just how a website works, everyone does this and everyone knows that everyone does this, I\ndon't see why people are all up in arms over this thing all of a sudden.</p>\n<p>I personally never collaborated with outside researchers while they were in academics, I worked\nwith a couple while they were Facebook employees on sabbatical, so the normal standards of data access\nwith outside academics did not apply. The decision to work with an outside researcher does go through\nsome scrutiny but it is not centralized in anyway, for instance any team that knows someone in academics\nthat could help solve a problem that Facebook has or better understand something can choose to reach\nout albeit with a friendly heads up to the academic partnership team, legal, and PR. No user identifiable\ninformation is ever revealed to external researchers, but there is a decent amount of anonymized data\nthat is shared for the express purpose of helping researchers understand human behaviour. For example,\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/230652223766114/\">this event</a> is an example of an event that has happened several times which is basically\na joint effort between internal and external researchers to understand how Facebook and social networks\nin general can be more compassionate. I am a bit taken aback by the fact that the most recent paper has\ngotten as much press as it has, when the work done as part of the compassion research days has never been\nmentioned. Some of these papers are based on experiments that influence people's behavior in similar ways,\nbut I guess they do not have as much cachet for whatever reason.</p>\n<p>There has always been a lot of ethical discussions around experiments being run. From the simplistic,\ni.e. will this be disruptive in a way that would simply annoy users, to the more complex, i.e.\nis the perceived benefit from the understanding that we will get from this test worth the potential\nnegative effect on users as well as any potential negative PR from a misunderstanding of the\nexperiment. Every data scientist at Facebook that I have ever interacted with has been deeply\npassionate about making the lives of people using Facebook better, but with the pragmatic\nunderstanding that sometimes you need to hurt the experience for a small number of users to help\nmake things better for 1+ billion others. That being said, all of this hubbub over 700k users like\nit is a large number of people is a bit strange coming from the inside where that is a very tiny\nfraction of the user base (less than 0.1%), and even that number is likely inflated to include a\ncontrol group. It truly is easy to get desensitized to the fact that those are nearly 1M real people\ninteracting with the site, and it is something that people constantly are trying to remind everyone\nof when working on the product. There is a lot of work to try to increase the empathy towards the\npeople using Facebook internally, so the backlash against Facebook is always doubly painful because\nthese really are good people trying to make things better. The PR team maybe does not get in front\nof these issues enough, but the only thing I see changing from this is not whether similar experiments\nwill be run, but rather will they be published. Similar experiments have been and will continue to be\nrun, but you probably just won't see a paper about it anymore. That is a real shame because Facebook\nand the data it has has been able to advance social psychology by quantum leaps over the past decade\nand this furor will undoubtedly slow that advance.</p>\n<p>I don't mind being quoted or not, in fact I would probably prefer not to be as I really don't want to\nbe putting my name out there attached to something that could be misconstrued by my friends who still\nwork at Facebook as me trying to go behind their backs and get publicity out of something bad happening\nto them. I quit Facebook in April of this year for a variety of reasons, but I still think they are doing\ngood things in the world, so above all I don't want to come across as bad mouthing them. That being said,\nthe plain truth is that the experiment that generated this paper is over 2 years old, so any discussion on\neither side about a review board is missing the point. Facebook as a corporation has to be weak in what\nthey say, but this study was the right thing to do, it was an interesting behavioural question, the\nexperimental design was solid, and the results were pretty clear and interesting. Furthermore, any\nexperiments are covered by the TOS and not only that, advertising is equivalent to trying to alter\nyour mood and behaviour. Every ad based company (Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Twitter, etc.) exists to\nalter how you perceive the world. The fact that a human stood up and said that is what they are doing\nis the only thing that is different here. So I have no idea why people are talking about this in the first place.</p>\n<h2>Further thoughts</h2>\n<p>I understand reading this how I was really an idiot saying anything like this to a reporter.\nIt is pretty clear that anything sounds bad out of context, but I really said some bad things out\nof context. I did give an example to the reporter of something that I worked on as an example of\nhow people did care about ethics even in situations where no one would ever know about the test.\nThis was a further mistake as it may or may not have violated some agreement that I may or may not\nhave about what I can say about what went on internally. The part that annoys me the most about\nthe article as it is written is how ridiculous I sound. Everyone I know who actually knows me who\nreached out to me, basically said the same thing, it sounds like you got duped. It is clear if you know\nme how I was represented is not accurate, but most people don't know me, so that sucks.</p>\n<p>Consider reading the following articles for more reasonable opinions about this whole mess:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/528756/refriending-facebook/\">Refriending Facebook</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://m.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/07/03/on-the-ethics-of-facebook-experiments/\">On the ethics of Facebook experiments</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Emails</h2>\n<p>Here are the emails between myself and the WSJ reporter if you want even more detailed information\naround the context of the day that this story was published. The majority of our disucussion\nwas on the phone, so I don't have word for word transcripts of that. Note, some lines have been\nremoved from these emails as I did not feel they actually added any extra information, these\nare in fact not the exact emails, but nothing has been altered other than removing a couple lines.\nThe lines I removed had to do with the fact that I asked to be quoted as \"Dr. Ledvina\" instead\nof \"Mr. Ledvina\" as well as the fact that I reached out to other former data scientists but\ntold the reporter that they did not want to speak as they thought it might be seen as going\nbehind the back of the people who currently work at FB. The only question I asked these people\nwas \"A guy from the WSJ wants to talk to data scientists from FB, you interested?\" They meant\nsimply that talking to a reporter at all was going behind someone's back, not that they nor I\nactually knew the actually gist of the story that was to be written.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From: Me</li>\n<li>To: <a href=\"mailto:reed.albergotti@wsj.com\">reed.albergotti@wsj.com</a></li>\n<li>July 2, 2014 11:41am</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't have time to talk on the phone, but if you have any questions you want answered\nI would be happy to do so via email. I only am willing to say anything more if I can see\nthe entirety of whatever is written prior to publication.</p>\n<p>I should also clarify that working as a data scientist at fb and being on the data science\nteam, the one that publishes papers including the most recent one, are two distinct things.\nI was not on the data science team although I was a data scientist.
