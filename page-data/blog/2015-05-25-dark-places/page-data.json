I have\ndecided after finishing this book that Gillian Flynn is one of my\nfavorite authors. All of her previous books had me on the edge of my\nseat, and this was no different. I highly recommend this to anyone,\nespecially if you were a fan of Gone Girl.</p>\n<p>Most people might feel that the subject matter is messed up, and the\nattitude of the characters is very dark. Personally, I just think it is\nmore real than most books usually are. Obviously the subject matter\nis morbid, but once you accept what occured, and who the characters are\nrelative to the events that took place, most of the book actually feels\npretty natural. I can't say that I had very interesting thoughts while\nreading the book. I was just thoroughly entertained, as can be clearly seen\nby the fact that I breezed through the 500+ pages in a couple days. I have\nbeen trying to pace books out a bit more, but I was too interested\nto find out what happened that I could not put the book down. Now I just\nneed her to write more books.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dark Places","date":"25 May 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","fiction","great","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":217},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-05-25-dark-places.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-05-25-dark-places/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
