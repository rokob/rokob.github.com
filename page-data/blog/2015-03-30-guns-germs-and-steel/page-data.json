Moreover from history class you recall that europeans\nwere able to overrun natives all of the world as they colonized\nthe new world. What is not actually obvious is why? Why did\nSpainards arrive in the Americas with germs and advanced\nmilitary technology that allowed them to conquer the natives\nrather than the other way around? This book answers that question.</p>\n<p>I really enjoy history especially the study of ultimate causes.\nWe know why the europeans destroyed the indigious people in the Americas,\nthey had more firepower, were resistant to certain diseases, and were\nmore organized. But that is not the ultimate cause. The ultimate cause\nhad to do solely with an accident of geography. Eurasia had a headstart\non food production and building resistance to germs because of the climate,\nexistence of easier to domesicate crops and animals, and a favorable major\naxis. There are a few other reasons, and all of them are laid out in detail\nin this book. The one answer thatis not true is that it is not that certain\npeople are less intelligent or naturally not as good as another. This book\nis clear to dispel of this racist answer by providing a convincing case for\nthe real answer.</p>\n<p>One issue with this book was that while quite interesting, it was still\npretty boring. I think this was mostly writing style and the tendency of\nthe author to repeat himself. After a couple hundred pages you get the point,\nbut he keeps hammering it home with more examples. While this is nice\nto cover all the bases, it still made it somewhat difficult to slog\nthrough to the end. Nonetheless, I recommend it to anyone interested in\nworld history.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Guns, Germs, and Steel","date":"30 Mar 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","nonfiction","history"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":336},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-03-30-guns-germs-and-steel.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-03-30-guns-germs-and-steel/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
