These books take me less\nthan 24 hours to put down, mostly because I have trouble doing\nanything else until I find out what happens next. If you liked\nthe first four, you'll be just as pleased with this one.</p>\n<p><em>Children of Dune</em> which I just finished before this one took me\nsomething like three weeks to read. Now I was not reading it in big\nchunks like I usually do instead reading something like 30-45 minutes\na day, but still that is a long time for me to read a book that is\nroughly 420 pages. <em>Takedown</em> which comes in at 433 pages took me\na day to read. I read in large chunks of time, I stayed up a little later\nthan I should have, I skipped doing some things I otherwise would have so\nI could keep reading, etc. I wonder if it is more the material and therfore\nmy interest level, or it is the style and writing and therefore more\nrelated to my ability to comprehend what is going on that accounts\nfor the difference in reading time. These Brad Thor books will never\nwin a Pulitzer, but they are fun and I enjoy the excitement of a\nfun story that is not too philosophical or deep. On the other hand,\n<em>Children of Dune</em> was overly philosophical at times and required\nme to digest what was going on in smaller chunks. It was not that deep\nor anything, it was just much more trying to have an underlying point\nthan just tell a story. This brings me back to the discussion I came\nacross earlier about kids books versus adult books. I could definitely\nread a hundred kids books a year, but I am not entirely sure if I would\nbe better off doing that than reading 20 adult books. I guess one\nneeds to define <em>better</em> before really being able to answer that question.\nI have found that I enjoy a mix of easier, enjoyable reading as well as\ndeeper, intellectually stimulating reading with probably a ratio of\ntwo or three easier books for every one deeper book.</p>\n<p>Anywho, <em>Takedown</em> was a quality addition to the Scot Harvath series\nwith yet another unique story with twists and turns from beginning\nto end. I think it probably could be read by itself, but there is\nquite a bit of back story that reading at least the first two\nbooks in the series would help with.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Takedown","date":"10 Dec 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","thriller"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":424},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-12-10-takedown.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-12-10-takedown/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
