I am not sure why I am sometimes able to suspend disbelief\nand sometimes I am overwhelmed with bullshit, but for some reason\nI have really enjoyed all of the Scot Harvath series. <em>Blowback</em> did\nnot disappoint, as it was right in line with the rest of the series\nin terms of pacing, action, suspense, and all around fun reading.</p>\n<p>One thing that has bothered me throughout the series, but didn't really\njump out at me until this book is the way the main character approaches\ncertain situations. He just has a way of doing and saying the wrong thing\nwhich seems so obvious to me that it is wrong. Ultimately these decisions\ncause some amount of trouble but lead to the desired outcome anyway. I am not\nsaying I expect the character to be perfect, but the bad decisions he makes\njust seem too bad to the point of being out of character for a former DEVGRU\nguy.</p>\n<p>Brad Thor keeps finding ways to introduce potential world shattering calamity\nin ways that are quite original. Although he did have the stereotypical Russians\nwith nukes plot in a previous book, that was still done with a twist. This book\nhas yet another interesting scenario that Harvath is able to essentially foil,\nbut which had me on the edge of my seat throughout wondering just how he was\ngoing to do it.</p>\n<p>I think this book could stand on its own, meaning that you could read and enjoy it\nwithout reading the first three, but there are still quite a bit of allusions to prior\nbooks that make reading these in order better than just randomly starting later on\nin the series.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blowback","date":"03 Nov 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":291},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-11-03-blowback.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-11-03-blowback/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
