I\nam so happy to have finally read it as the movie now makes a bit more sense.</p>\n<p>The movie sticks pretty faithfully to the book so in this instance I think watching the movie is not\nthat much of a loss relative to the original material. Clearly your imagination gets to do more work\nin the book, but having seen the movie first I ended up picturing a lot of what Stanley Kubrick\ncreated. Nevertheless, the ending of the movie has always been a topic of debate and confusion for\nme. The book, on the other hand, is basically clear as to what is going on. The movie follows this\nbut without the explanation as to what it all means. I need to go back and watch the movie now armed\nwith my foreknowledge, as I think the whole thing will be much more fulfilling.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"2001: A Space Odyssey","date":"02 Jun 2019","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":178},"fields":{"sha":"f5ca3ccd46b205eb229b64f8350b17106dff5b3c"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2019-06-02-2001-a-space-odyssey.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2019-06-02-2001-a-space-odyssey/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
