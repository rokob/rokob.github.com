Originally written in German in 1922, this is\ntruly an odd book.</p>\n<p>The entire story must have multiple layers of meaning otherwise\nit would really just be a boring story about the life of a guy\nin India. Much of the book is trying to tell you some deeper truth\nabout life through metaphors, but also blantaly just saying certain\nideas. Thus it is hard to really grapple with what is happening\nand what you are feeling unless you consciously take a step\nback and really think about the meaning behind what you are reading.</p>\n<p>All that being said, I had two big takeaways from the book that were\njust said pretty clearly. Although you need to read the book and get\nthe reasoning behind these ideas and the metaphors that go along with them,\nthese two quotes capture a lot of the main essence of what I think\nthe author was trying to get across. First,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Searching means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open,\nhaving no goal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem with trying to accomplish a goal as your search for meaning\nin life is that you will not be able to see the end of your search even\nif it is staring you in the face. You will not be open to having to goal\nwhile still searching and hence your search will be eternal and fruitless.\nSomething like that. This comes across as contradictory or even leading to\nhedonism, but there is a deeper truth here that has some real wisdom,\nhowever the next bit will explain why this is hard to explain.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wisdom cannot be passed on. Wisdom which a wise man tries to pass on\nto someone always sounds like foolishness.\n...\nKnowledged can be conveyed, but not wisdom. It can be found, it can be\nlived, it is possible to be carried by it, miracles can be performed with\nit, but it cannot be expressed in words and taught.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So all is for naught then. This sentiment while extreme is backed up by\nmy own experience so I found it believeable. It is a bit of a runaround\nthough as this idea is wisdom in itself so it is almost like the\ncontradiction \"This sentence is a lie\". I have found the wisdom I have\ngained over each year to be something that, even if told to me when I was\nyounger, I would not have believed. I needed the experience to win the\nwisdom to fully internalize it. Now that I know that, I try to take a\ndifferent view when I hear tidbits of information, try to see if it is\nsomething that I can learn now without having to learn myself the hard\nway. Even being aware of that possibility, it is a hard feat to accomplish.</p>\n<p><em>Siddhartha</em> was a good book for getting me to think about some ideas\nand ways of living. This particular edition was horrendous in terms of\ngrammar and editing, so maybe steer clear of the Kindle edition. Additionally,\nit is short and to the point, so unlike some other philisophical stories, this\ndid not put me to sleep as often.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Siddhartha","date":"30 Jan 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","life"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":557},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-01-30-siddhartha.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-01-30-siddhartha/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
