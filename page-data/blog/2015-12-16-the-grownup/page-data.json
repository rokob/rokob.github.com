It is a ghost story with her usual\ntwists and turns. I definitely recommend it.</p>\n<p>One thing I have learned about Flynn's style is that she\nalways has some big world changing twist near the end.\nSometimes that can go overboard like M. Night Shyamalan,\nbut somehow she manages to make the twists believable,\nunexpected, and somehow necessary. That is, rather than\nfeeling like the whole book was jerking you around just\nto get that twist, you feel as if the twist is very natural\nand you are somehow stupid for not seeing it sooner. I think\nthis short story was different in that she pulled off multiple\ntwists in a quite small number of pages.</p>\n<p>All that being said, I do not want to come across as saying\nthis is a masterpiece. This is the worst of the things\nthat I have read by her, but that does not mean it is bad.\nHer other books are better, partially because they are\nlong enough to really develop the characters and plot. This\nwas too short to do a lot, so it did pretty well with\nwhat room it had to work with.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Grownup","date":"16 Dec 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","fiction","good","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":226},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-12-16-the-grownup.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-12-16-the-grownup/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
