I do not think that my most\nrecent read, <a href=\"http://amzn.com/B000O76ON6\"><em>Neuromancer</em></a>, is consindered to be the\nbest scifi book out there, but it is certainly considered to be a very\ngood book and an important part of the science fiction literature. It is\noften citied as the book which introduced the concept of cyberspace and\nstarting the cyberpunk trend.</p>\n<p>I thought the book was okay, I mean it was novel especially taken in the\ncontext that it was written 30 years ago, but I would not call it great.\nMuch of it was rambling and incoherent. I understood what was going on,\nas much as one can, and there were definitely some interesting bits, but\nfor the most part it seemed to be trying a bit too hard to be over the top\nstrange for the sake of it. I would like to read something else within the\nsame universe as there are some interesting concepts going on.</p>\n<p>Ultimately the book was weird to the point of being unintersting and\ndissatisfying. It was short, and there was enough to keep me going along\nwith the hope that something interesting was going to happen. There were\nsome interesting flashes, but overall it was not great, just okay.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Neuromancer","date":"07 Jul 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","okay","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":237},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-07-07-neuromancer.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-07-07-neuromancer/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
