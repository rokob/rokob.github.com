This was quite the interesting\nread, although my bimodal reaction to fantasy worlds made it hard for me to get into it until I was\nhalfway through. That is, I either fully accept some world and get immersed in it and the reading is\na breeze, or for some reason I just hate all the weird names and find it hard to slog through.\nOverall this was a good book, not my top tier of science fiction, but very close.</p>\n<p>The book is set in a different universe perhaps than the one we live in, that is a bit vague. There\nis an alien sent to a planet of cold and ice called Winter as an envoy of a group of worlds that\nhave banded together to share knowledge and culture. The planet of Winter is inhabited by only men,\nor more precisely humans who can switch between being men and women during the few days of the month\nwhen they are sexually active. The rest of the time they are androgynous. This leads to an entirely\nnovel culture around sex, child rearing, etc. The alien is basically us trying to wrap his head\naround this concept and work with it.</p>\n<p>It is very interesting to see the world of alien contact from the point of view of the alien. I have\nnot really encountered that style before and I think it is certainly an interesting thread. The book\ndives into some interesting moral and philosophical ideas around duality. Lack of gender in their\nsociety means that there is not a man/woman dualism but there still is an us/them dualism. The\nquestion being whether duality is a fundamental part of humanity, of life. Light being the left hand\nof darkness, yin and yang.</p>\n<p>I am adding <em>The Dispossessed</em> to my list which I will get around to eventually. Interestingly\nenough I read Taya's paper copy rather than buying it on my Kindle which is the first paper book I\nhave read in quite some time. I found the experience to be illuminating as to how much better the\nKindle experience is. I read while eating and doing other things which is very hard when you have to\nphysically hold the pages open. I forgot how hard until reading this. The Kindle has revolutionized\nmy relationship with reading, not with books, but with the act of reading. I would be hard pressed\nto go back to physical books at this point even though for the longest time I was a literary luddite.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","date":"01 Mar 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","scifi","society","good"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":452},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-03-01-the-left-hand-of-darkness.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-03-01-the-left-hand-of-darkness/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
