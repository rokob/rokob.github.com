I just finished it and I think it was\nquite good. It was overhyped in my opinion, maybe that is\njust a product of who I have been talking to, or maybe\nit just isn't the holy grail. Nonetheless, I recommend reading\nit to anyone, especially if you are interested in starting\na company or interested in how technology companies rise\nand fall.</p>\n<p>I have a lot of thoughts about the book, most of them are\nhard to put precisely into words because I did not take\nnotes while reading. One aspect that bothered me was the\npresumption that economic theory consists of two models for\nfirms in the market: perfect competion and monopoly. As\nsomeone who spent four years getting a PhD where I studied\nexactly the area between these two, I may be biased, but\nthe common misunderstanding about what goes on between these\nextremes and why is more pervasive than I thought. I just\nassumed that people who spend time thinking about this stuff\nwould realize the very important world in this middle region,\nbut alas that does not seem to be true.</p>\n<p>There is also an implicit assumption that colors the narrative.\nThis assumption is that building a billion dollar company\nis what you should want to do. Additionally, there is this\nunderlying current of loathing for those who don't have that\nas their life's ambition. I felt like part of the book was\noverly preachy to the segment of society that sees themselves\nas the solution to all the world's problems. Maybe that is\nwhy there is so much buzz in the valley over this book, because\nit really strokes the ego of most of the people here.</p>\n<p>However, the majority of the book is focused a bit more\ntactically on how to build a company, and what questions one\nneeds to ask themselves to decide if their idea/company will\nbe successful or not. This was very well articulated and\ndefinitely contained some ideas that I had never thought of\nexplicitly before. I don't really want to get into the blow\nby blow account of what I thought was interesting or not, so\nI will just leave it at that.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Zero To One","date":"17 Feb 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","nonfiction","business"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":389},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-02-17-zero-to-one.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-02-17-zero-to-one/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
