I have a suspicion that those\nwho pontificate on <em>Walden</em> only read the first couple\nand maybe the last chapter. There are some interesting bits\nin the chapter titled \"Where I Lived, and What I Lived For\"\nand again a few in the conclusion. However, the majority\nof the book is one of the most boring things I have ever\nsubjected myself to.</p>\n<p>Thoreau writes at length\nabout where and when he saw a particular bird show up during\nthe fall and spring. If you actually read this whole thing,\nevery word, I dare you to say that less than 90% of it is extremely\nrepetative and boring.</p>\n<p>In the substitantive parts, Thoreau often contradicts himself\nand comes across as whining. I get why people like it if they\nare only focusing on the quoteable parts that they agree with.\nTake for instance some of these quotes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can\nafford to let alone</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- -->\n<blockquote>\n<p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front\nonly the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn\nwhat it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover\nthat I had not lived.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- -->\n<blockquote>\n<p>Those services which the community will most readily pay for,\nit is most disagreeable to render.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- -->\n<blockquote>\n<p>The prophets are employed in excusing the ways of men.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- -->\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our life is frittered away by detail. An honest man has hardly\nneed to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme cases\nhe may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity,\nsimplicity, simplicity!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are a few more that I marked but you get the idea. There are\ncertainly some pithy sayings that people could hold on to and form\ntheir lives around. If one does this then they must regard the entire\nwork of <em>Walden</em> as a masterpiece. But, I tell you, it is mostly a waste\nof time.</p>\n<p>I also read <em>Civil Disobedience</em> which I found to be much more palatable,\nthis might be because it had a sense of focus and it was significanly\nshorter. The same underlying moral philosophy can be found there as well,\nincluding the self contradiction.</p>\n<p>This book is only okay and I am now happy it is off my list of\nthings that I just have to read.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Walden","date":"21 Jul 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","nonfiction","okay"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":407},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-07-21-walden.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-07-21-walden/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
