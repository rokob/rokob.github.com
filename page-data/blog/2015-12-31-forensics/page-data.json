It is basically\na series of anecdotes, interviews, and case studies\nabout a variety of different techniques used to catch\nand prosecute criminals.</p>\n<p>I thought this book was just okay because there was a lack\nof depth. Specifically, I wanted to hear more about specific\ntechniques and methodologies at a more detailed and scientific\nlevel. As it stands, this is a survey of what exists at the highest\nlevel, with an example case or two that demonstrates where the\ntechnique was first used or where it was very important to the\noutcome.</p>\n<p>One strange aspect of this book for me personally was that\nthe author is British and therefore most of the examples\nare in the UK legal system. I say this is strange because\nthere is quite a bit of difference between the UK and US legal\nsystems as well as how juries react to certain evidence.\nTherefore, I think it would be interesting to find examples\nstrictly from the US legal system that are parallel to the ones\nin the UK in this book. The forensic techniques are basically\nthe same so for that purpose the setting did not really\nmatter.</p>\n<p>After reading this book, I may look into more detailed books\nthat focus on one or two of the different forensic sciences alone.\nAll that being said, if you want a quick overview of the reality\nbehind shows like CSI and Law &#x26; Order, then this is definitely\nsomething good to pick up.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Forensics","date":"31 Dec 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","nonfiction","okay"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":280},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-12-31-forensics.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-12-31-forensics/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
