But as the action picks up, the issues with the writing recede. I would\ncertainly recommend this if you enjoy the whodunit genre, especially if you are one to read the book\nbefore the movie as supposedly the movie is coming soon. Not as good as Gillian Flynn, but still\nworthwhile.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"In a Dark, Dark Wood","date":"31 Jan 2019","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","fiction","okay","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":118},"fields":{"sha":"05a537a522629308387b79f7117288498977cc4d"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2019-01-31-in-a-dark-dark-wood.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2019-01-31-in-a-dark-dark-wood/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
