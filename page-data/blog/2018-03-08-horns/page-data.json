I can't remember if this book was in there or not, but I think\npossibly one of his other books, <em>NOS4A2</em>, was in there. It led to this discussion about <em>Horns</em>,\nStephen King, the movie based on the book, and the entire genre of american horror. I am really\nquite pleased that I got around to reading this as soon as I did because I am for sure going to add\nthe rest of his books to my reading list.</p>\n<p>There is just enough fantasy in this book to make the ridiculous situation seem plausible if you are\nwilling to just accept what is going on. Thematically I really got into this book. The basic gist\nbeing that some guy is maybe the devil or a demon so he has horns growing out of his head. The horns\nseem to have a power over people that make them tell him their darkest secrets. It makes you think\nwhat you would confess in that situation. Usually people are confessing what they want to do in that\nmoment, but sometimes it has to do with things they've done in the past. I would like to think that\nI am not too ashamed of my past self, but there certainly has to be some stuff that would not be\ngreat to share.</p>\n<p>I am looking forward to his other books and I would highly recommend this one. It is a quick and\nhilarous read.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Horns","date":"09 Mar 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":275},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-03-08-horns.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-03-08-horns/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
