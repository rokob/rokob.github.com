What I read of this book was good, but\nI just kept finding other things to do instead of continuing\nto read it. This went on for quite some time and was exacerbated\nby the fact that I got a new computer that was actually enjoyable\nto use. So lo and behold I just finished my first book in\nover a month and it was the sequel to <em>Dune</em>,\n<a href=\"http://amzn.com/B0011UGNDG\"><em>Dune Messiah</em></a>.</p>\n<p><em>Dune Messiah</em> was different than <em>Dune</em> in many ways, but\nin my opinion it was just as good. I found these two books to be\nsimilar to how <em>Empire Strikes Back</em> compares to <em>A New Hope</em>.\nThe second book was darker and definitly had more of an open ended\nending that really makes you want to see how things will turn out\nin the third installment. I want to say that I actually liked\nthe second book more than the first in a lot of ways. Overall,\nI think the first was better because it had so much more breadth,\nwhich, while not often better, was done better than almost any other\nfantasy book I have read.</p>\n<p>Many people do not like <em>Dune Messiah</em> because of the antihero\nstatus that Paul takes on. I heard that before reading this book,\nso I was aware of the critque, and to be honest I did not really\nfind that to be a negative at all. The way I interpreted many\nof the actions of Paul, were as someone who was trying to make\nthe best of a situation that he saw as inevitable due to his\noracular powers. There were things set in motion during the first\nbook that foreshadowed most of the outcome in the second, so I did\nnot really understand why people would say it took a hero and brought\nhim down. It is said that <em>Dune Messiah</em> is a cautionary tale of\nthe abuse and corruption that goes along with absolute power.\nWhile I see this point of view, I actually thought Paul should\nthe inner conflict of someone with power that usually gets ignored\nwhen you view such a person from the outside. If you only focus on\nthe Jihad in his name you do not fully appreciate the decision making\nprocess he goes through nor the pain he feels for what goes on\naround him. This was mentioned repreatedly in <em>Dune</em> as he tried\nto find a way out of what he saw to be his fate. Therefore,\nI found this to be a really fitting sequel as well as a great book\non its own. I am really looking forward to reading the third book.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dune Messiah","date":"28 Oct 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","scifi"]},"timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":467},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-10-28-dune-messiah.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-10-28-dune-messiah/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
