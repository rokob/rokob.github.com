This is the\nmetaphysics that was missing from the former book. I feel the latter book stands by itself, but to\nreally grasp what is going on it certainly was helpful to have read the first book.</p>\n<p>The ideas in this book, like in <em>Zen</em> are in some sense obvious, in that if you try to explain them\nto someone else, they often look at you confused as to why you are so enthralled with this obvious\nexplanation of life. Maybe that is what really feels like there is right here. The conflict between\nstability and dynamic quality, the necessity of both in bringing about positive change, is really\nclear if you explain it metaphorically. However, internalizing this idea is actually harder to nail\ndown. For instance, quotes such as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Good is a noun</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>are concise, clear when you think about it a little bit, but harder to fully grasp when you really\nstart to think deeply. Other ideas such as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sanity is conforming to what is socially expected. Truth is sometimes in conformity, sometimes\nnot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>are more plainly true and not that groundbreaking. The book is packed with quoteable tidbits, like</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If ritual always comes first and intellectual principles always come later, then ritual cannot\nalways be a decadent corruption of intellect. Their sequence in history suggests that principles\nemerge from ritual, not the other way around. That is, we don't perform religious rituals because\nwe believe in God. We believe in God because we perform religous retuals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Overall, I think this is a worthy followup to the first book, well worth the time spent reading it.\nThere is a lot of heavy thinking that can happen if you want to invest the time in this book. A\ncertain level of mental freedom is required to really juggle some of the ideas here because compared\nto the norm they can seem out there at times. I am pretty happy I read this even though it took\nlonger than I would have thought.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals","date":"10 Mar 2017","categories":"book","tags":["book","good","nonfiction","philosophy"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":361},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2017-03-10-lila-an-inquiry-into-morals.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017-03-10-lila-an-inquiry-into-morals/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
