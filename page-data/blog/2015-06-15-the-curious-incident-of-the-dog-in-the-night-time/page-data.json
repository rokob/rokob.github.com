He is pretty far to one end of\nthe spectrum where he has violent reactions to being\ntouched and similar behaviours that are atypical in most\nof society. The other end of the spectrum has people\nwho have been able to learn more about people's emotions\nand societal norms which enables them to emulate those\nbehaviours and hence fit in.</p>\n<p>I found this book to be very interesting. It was a good\nstory first and foremost. There were some plot twists,\na decent amount of character development, and generally\nthe writing was clear. One has to take into account the\nway someone with Autism thinks in order to really appreciate\nthe book. I found the view into this kid's mind to be\nenlightening. As his thought process is quite logcial and\nfact based, it was quite easy to read this book very quickly.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time","date":"15 Jun 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great","personality"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":191},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-06-15-the-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-06-15-the-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
