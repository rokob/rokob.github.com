Ledgard although it\nis the second book of his that I have read. I forget why I initially read\n<a href=\"http://andrewledvina.com/blog/2015-12-14-submergence/\"><em>Submergence</em></a>, but afterwards I wanted to read something else by\nLedgard and I figured his debut was a good a place as any to look.</p>\n<p><em>Giraffe</em> is technically based on a true story, but it definitely falls into\nthe historical fiction category more than nonfiction. His writing style is\ndescriptive and had me looking up words every now and then. I think part of\nthat is him being from Scotland and currently living in Africa. There are just\ncertain phrasings that are uncommon in America that I think are more common\nin Great Britain.</p>\n<p>I mentioned I was reading this book to someone and when I tried to describe it,\na book about giraffes in Czechoslovakia during the 70s with part of the story\ntold by a Giraffe herself, I realized how out there it seemed. The reality though\nis much more of a humanistic study than historical. The thoughts and feelings\nof those involved are really what drives this book forward, It just so happens\nthat there is a surreal plot and setting that they are living in. What is even\nmore crazy is that this is basically true, one of those truth stranger than fiction\nscenarios. Most of the stories set in the communist countries during the 1960s and 1970s\nare really hard to believe from someone like me based on when and where I was born.\nPart of that is based on movies and books making a caricature of those places at that\ntime that the reality seems to be mixed up with stereotypical fictionalizations to the\npoint that it is hard to accept the truth.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Giraffe","date":"26 Apr 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","great"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":295},"fields":{"sha":"3a23f0ef6a8f1235cb8656de6d03275c3729a226"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-04-26-giraffe.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-04-26-giraffe/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
