Reading such a book at a different\ntime in my life had a different feeling with a dispassionate distance. Now I found a swelling of\nemotions when projecting those close to me into certain scenarios. It was unsettling.</p>\n<p>This is a great book, but some might find it not much of a book and more along the line of\njournalism. The majority of the book is a blow by blow accounting of interviews with one man who\nstarts out as a potential witness and gradually becomes maybe something more. There are a lot of\npeople involved in the case and to tell the truth not much by the way of answers. Certainly some\nthings are figured out and explained to us the reader, but due to the passage of time, some things\nare lost forever.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Last Stone","date":"14 May 2019","categories":"book","tags":["book","crime","great","history","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":162},"fields":{"sha":"71a9de36d007d45af742e837fdee44013722e25e"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2019-05-14-the-last-stone.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2019-05-14-the-last-stone/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
