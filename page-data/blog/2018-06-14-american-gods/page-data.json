I\nthink someone asked me if I liked Neil Gaiman and as usual I said \"Who?\" This is a road trip book\nat its core as well as a book about American culture.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed this book, it was well written and had a fun story. I really did not enjoy the chapter\nlengths. For some reason, I read books with long chapters really slowly. I have a feeling it is not\nthe chapter length per se, but rather long chapters are indicative of the flow of the story. If you\ncan't tick off landmarks on a regular basis it usually means the story is complex in how it unfolds.\nThis definitely fit that bill.</p>\n<p>I recommend this book, and I may pick up another Neil Gaiman book in the future, but it was\ndefinitely a slog.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"American Gods","date":"14 Jun 2018","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","scifi"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":152},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2018-06-14-american-gods.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-06-14-american-gods/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
