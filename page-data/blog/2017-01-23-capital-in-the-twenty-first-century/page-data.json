I have a background in economics and an interest\nin books that take very long term perspectives so this naturally made it on to my reading list. I\nhave been putting it off for a while and finally just decided that it was time to get down to it. An\nexceptional book if only for the reason that he made the effort to collect the data and put forth a\nsystematic analysis of wealth and income inequality throughout the world and over a span of more\nthan 200 years. His interpretations of the data are not necessarily full-proof nor are his\nmoral assumptions strictly universal, but this does not detract from a great piece of scholarly\nwork.</p>\n<p>One of the best reasons to read this book is that data is presented which dispels many commonly held\nmisconceptions about wealth both within certain countries as well as wealth and inequality in\nrelative terms between countries, primiarly between the US and Europe. There are certain beliefs\nthat seem to be common knowledge among a large proportion of the population, in the US at least,\nwhich are patently false. For example, the idea that America is owned or is increasingly being owned\nby foreign investors, the Chinese in particular, is put forth as a sign that certain policies or\nfacets of government or industry are failing. The reality is that net public wealth is close to zero\nwith any foreign holdings almost perfectly offset by corresponding domestic holdings of foreign\ncapital. We do not have other countries to fear, the only fear for the average American should be\nfrom within our borders.</p>\n<p>The extremely short version of the book is that the relationship between the rate of return on\ncapital, <em>r</em>, and the growth rate of output and labor, <em>g</em>, determines the level of inequality in the\nlong run. If <em>r > g</em>, then without some intervening mechanism, wealth will tend to concentrate in an\nincreasingly small minority of hands. We are most likely entering a period where <em>r</em> will remain\nbasically stable and <em>g</em> will decrease. Therefore we are likely to see inequality get worse unless\nsomething is done to prevent this situation.</p>\n<p>While the book tries to emphasize that income inequality is not bad in itself, there is still a\ndecently strong predisposed viewpoint that it is morally problematic for an individual to accumulate\na significantly large amount of wealth, an obscene amount in colloquial terms.\nThe author takes as a foundational assumption that one\nagrees with the statement \"Social distinctions can be based only on common utility.\" from\n<em>Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen</em>. How one interprets this defines the level of\nwealth deemed obscene. The extremes being that any amount of inequality is obscene and no amount of\ninequality is obscene. The real distinction seems to come from where the wealth came from and how it\nis being used. To benefit common utility the most, wealth should be distributed into the hands that\nwill make the most productive use of it. In some cases, the most productive uses are to reward\nsomeone for labor that is itself productive. The incentive to work is a useful allocation of\ncapital. The author agrees with this sentiment. Static wealth which only serves to grow itself is\nwhat is deemed obscene. Moreover wealth that is passed down across generations either via\ninheritance or gift is deemed to be essentially unfair and thus this source of wealth is seen as\nmore obscene than the wealth obtained via labor income. While many people have this viewpoint, it is\nnot necessarily universal. Cast in these terms it makes sense that the proposed policy to remedy\ninequality is a progressive global tax on capital. If you make productive use of your wealth above\nand beyond the tax rate and inflation rate, then it makes sense for you to have the wealth that you\ndo. On the other hand, if tax plus inflation eats away your capital because you are not using it,\nthen this redistribution is morally correct. That is the basic gist of the argument as I read it.\nOne might ask why a progressive tax? There are a variety of arguments that appeal to morality,\nempathy, and social justice. These are all economically unappealing. However, there is a decent\neconomic argument which allows one to skirt the moral quagmire. The rate of return is an increasing\nfunction of initial stake. In other words, larger fortunes can earn a greater return than smaller\nfortunes, ceteris paribus. There are a variety of reasons for this, but it is more or less an\nempirical fact. Hence, to force capital to be used dyanmically, one must institute a progressive tax\nto account for the increasing baseline return on capital.</p>\n<p>One issue I had with the book is the use of averages in certain areas. Many important parts are\nbroken down into percentiles which allows for an accurate view into the distribution. However,\nwithin the say top 1% of the wealth distribution, we are left looking at average rates of return and\nthe like. There are distributions in the other dimension that are also important. This issue is\nraised by the author and basically explained away frequently. It is very hard to present\nmultivariate distributions in a way that is digestable in clear graphs or tables. I understand that,\nbut some effort to even use medians or other percentiles in some places might have been nice.</p>\n<p>Overall I highly recommend this book. If you want to understand what wealth really means and how\nvarious rich countries are really organized around labor and capital, you need to read this book.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Capital in the Twenty-First Century","date":"24 Jan 2017","categories":"book","tags":["book","great","history","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":4,"wordCount":{"words":996},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2017-01-23-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017-01-23-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
