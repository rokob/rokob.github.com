I've been working a\nlot lately and haven't written all of these book posts close enough to when I finished these books.\nI am hoping to get to reading more soon and have a plan on how to get these written at the same time\nas I finish a book.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend this book, but the first part is a dumpster fire.
