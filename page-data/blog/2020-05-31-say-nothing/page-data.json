This is a fantastic book with a wealth of information.\nIt tells the story of The Troubles through the lens of the disappearance (read: murder) of Jean\nMcConville. I learned a great deal and it made me interested in finding more books on the subject. I\npresume my lack of knowledge of this period is a product of the selection of topics covered in the\nstandard history curriculum in America.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Say Nothing","date":"31 May 2020","categories":"book","tags":["book","great","history"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":93},"fields":{"sha":"be118f06ece878c169765bc6c923f005c357028b"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2020-05-31-say-nothing.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2020-05-31-say-nothing/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
