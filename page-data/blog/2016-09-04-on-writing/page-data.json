I have\nalways loved the creative process of writing, both fiction and nonfiction. However, I have never\nreally dedicated myself to writing anything of any substance. I find myself paralyzed at the\nbeginning, unsure how to start, even though I have what I consider to be a good idea for a story.\nThis book gave me a lot of ideas and tools for how to move forward and perhaps actually finish\nsomething for a change.</p>\n<p>The first half or so of the book is an autobiography. Reading it, I realized that I have never\nactually read anything by Stephen King, I have only seen the movie versions of his books. That is\ndefinitely going to change now, because his style is something that jelled with me. Understanding\nhis background and how that influenced his writing was useful to hear.</p>\n<p>Many of his ideas on writing were eye opening to me. I would not say they are revolutionary, but\nsmall things about focusing on the story and starting from a situation, are quite useful to someone\nwho often gets mired in the details. I have heard from other authors that they try to get a feel for\nthe language of their characters and then just listen to what happens in their head. He did not\nnecessary say this in so many words, but his process is one of letting the story tell itself. He\ncompared the creative process as akin to unearthing a fossil. It reminded me of Michalangeo\ndescribing sculpting as his letting the statue that exists inside the marble out rather than him\nimbuing his own structure. The idea that what you are trying to create already exists and you are\nmerely reveling it resonates with me. I have felt that in other areas before and it is a wonderful\nfeeling. This book has inspiried me to really give writing a serious go rather than continuing my\nexistence as a dilettante.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"On Writing","date":"04 Sep 2016","categories":"book","tags":["book","great","nonfiction"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":334},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2016-09-04-on-writing.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-09-04-on-writing/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
