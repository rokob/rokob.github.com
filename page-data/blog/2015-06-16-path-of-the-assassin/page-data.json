I\nknow these less-than-realistic military/spy pop-fiction thrillers\nare what some consider to be non-intellectual reading, but I\nreally don't care. I really enjoy these books. They are fun,\nthey are easy to read, and they keep me engaged. Much of the\nplot isn't too crazy, there is just enough realism to keep\nthings interesting.</p>\n<p>I am looking forward to continuing on reading some of the\nother books in this series. I am sure that <em>The Lions of Lucerne</em>\nis going to be made into a movie at some point, so I am pretty\nexcited to watch that when it comes out in a few years. I think\nthis book was more fast paced than the first, but had slightly\nless character development. Perhaps that was because many of the\ncharacters were already described in the previous book. This was\nalso much more linear in terms of the story line, whereas his\nprevious book had multiple things going on at once that eventually\nconverged. Nonetheless, enjoyable read.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Path of the Assassin","date":"16 Jun 2015","categories":"book","tags":["book","fiction","good","military","thriller"]},"timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":197},"fields":{"sha":"9a9b8cc9a846a5ab6c26cb187880f3092ad02345"},"parent":{"relativePath":"2015-06-16-path-of-the-assassin.md"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2015-06-16-path-of-the-assassin/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3192915761"],"slicesMap":{}}
